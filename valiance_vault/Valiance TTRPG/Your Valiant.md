# 4    Your Valiant

## 4.1  Creating an Aspirant

Before you can dive into your story, all players must create their aspirant valiants. An aspirant is a valiant without any completed contracts under their belt. An overwhelming majority of aspirants are maimed or killed before they become a tenured valiant. It’s like an internship for mercenary work.

### Defining Your Character

Before beginning the mechanical process of building a character, it’s important to establish who your character is and how they fit into the world. This process is mostly unstructured, with different groups of players designing characters in different ways. It’s important to ensure everyone playing is on the same page about what sort of characters and narrative they desire.

### Defining Your Roles

Before a group of players begins the process of character creation, they should first start with determining what sort of team they want to be a part of, and what roles exist within that team. Below are some very general roles that work well together. As you become more familiar with the system, you may find yourself creating more exotic lineups of valiants.

#### Defenders and Controllers

One of the most important roles in any company are the dedicated defensive valiants. Most valiants want to survive long enough to enjoy their paychecks, and defensive and control characters work to drastically increase a company’s survival rate.

Functionally, these characters focus on being the (sometimes literal) barrier between their allies and a swift death. They can usually take a hit and wield a host of abilities that make it incredibly difficult for their enemies to operate freely on the battlefield. This role, however, often lacks any permanent solution to enemy neutralization.

The valiant archetypes most commonly used in this role are distortionists, warders, tricksters, and sentinels.

#### Damage Dealers

Whatever exactly they may call themselves, valiants in this role have honed their combat talents to a deadly edge. They specialize in downing enemy characters and are the main driving force in any combat situation.

Characters in this role usually have a singular focus in both their character build and in combats: take the enemy down as quickly as possible. This strategy leaves little room for self-preservation, and these characters rely heavily on their allies to give them room to do their job.

These characters tend to invest in the artillerist, fanatic, and skirmisher archetypes.

  

#### Force Multipliers

Worth very little on their own, force multipliers act to enhance the capabilities of their allies and create strategic openings on the battlefield. With the right combination of tactics, these characters can allow a team of valiants to face off against armies.

Worth almost nothing on their own but can allow their allies to face insurmountable odds. It’s normal for most companies to have less force multipliers than any other role, since on their own they tend to be weaker than other roles.

Valiants fitting into this role usually invest in the analyst and commander archetypes.

#### Versatility in Roles

Naturally, valiants tend not to fit neatly into well-defined buckets, and most characters will exist as a blend of the above roles. Some characters may break the molds of roles entirely, defining their own place in their team. Generally, if something works (or even if you just think it might work), it’s worth trying out. Given, of course, that the rest of your group is fine with a bit of experimentation.

### Building an Aspirant Character

This section outlines the required steps when creating a fresh valiant. They don’t necessarily have to be done in the order laid out below but are necessary for putting together a functional character.

#### Attribute Points

An aspirant has 2 initial Attribute points they may allocate to the following attributes as they wish:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Attribute**|**Increase Per Point**|
|Energy|1|
|Guts|2|
|Lethality|1|
|Movement|1|

#### Selecting Lineages

Next, you must define your valiant’s lineage. An Archian’s lineage is their unique genetic blend, traceable back to the original seven tribes of the barrier. Rarely, Archians can be born as Cossim, a pseudo-lineage that appears as a sort of genetic anomaly.

When building a valiant, you do not necessarily select individual lineages. Instead, you select two traits or abilities from the lineage pools, and your selections determine your character’s dominant (or co-dominant) lineages. A full list of lineages and all of their trait and ability pools can be found in the Lineage Compendium chapter.

Then, once your dominant lineage or lineages are determined, you gain the utility effects of those lineages.

  

#### Selecting an Aspirant Archetype

As a tier 0 valiant, your character is referred to as an aspirant, or one who aspires to valiancy. This means that they don’t yet have the skills or experience of a true valiant and must rely on ordinary life experience when trying to find an edge in this dangerous line of work.

You must select a single aspirant archetype from the list of aspirant archetypes. Each archetype contains two traits or abilities, along with a utility effect and a list of possible origins. You will gain both traits and abilities under the archetype you select, along with the utility effect. Note that normally, characters can only ever have one aspirant archetype, so choose wisely based on the role you intend to fill in your company. The full list of aspirant archetypes can be found in the Archetypes Compendium chapter.

Along with traits, abilities, and utility effects, aspirant archetypes come with a short list of potential origins. Since an aspirant archetype works as a sort of background for your valiant, this is when you determine the specific origin of your character. You may use one of the listed origins as written, modify one of them to suit your character, or work with your game master to create a unique origin for you character.

#### Gathering Your Starting Equipment

Even veteran valiants know how valuable the right piece of equipment is, and as an aspirant your armaments may be all you have to rely on.

As a tier 0 character, you may select up to three pieces of tier 0 equipment. A full list of all equipment items can be found in the Equipment Compendium chapter, with base weapons and base armor sets acting as tier 0 equipment for those two categories.

Along with your starting equipment, you also bring with you any single item from the Tools and Travel section that does not exceed ƭ25,000. This item cannot normally be sold or otherwise converted to Tin.

#### Selecting Your Free Utility Effect

When creating a new character, you have one free utility effect that you can select from the Utility Effect Compendium chapter. You must meet the listed requirements for the utility effect you choose.

#### Company Planning

Normally, fresh tier 0 characters do not yet belong to a company. However, depending on your story (and game master guidance), it might be a good idea to start working on something for your group of aspirants.

  

## 4.2  Valiant Growth

As valiants complete contracts, their wealth and experience grow. As far as the game goes, this means an increase in character tier along with the funds to acquire new hardware. Growth also happens on the company level, and valiants are free to pool their resources and expand the capabilities of their organization.

As a rule, all player valiants in a company tier up at the same time, and they are always at the same tier. This tier is often referred to as the players’ character tier, but it is also sometimes referred to as the company tier.

### Increasing Your Valiant’s Tier

The main form of progression in valiance is the individual valiant’s progression through the game’s tiers of gameplay. As your character grows beyond tier 0 – all the way to the legendary tier 10 character – you’ll have many decisions to make that will define your valiant’s capabilities in and out of combat.

#### Universal Scaling Attributes

Every time a character’s tier increases, their Guts and Energy values increase by 2 and 1, respectively. This occurs in addition to increases from Attribute Points.

#### Additional Attribute Points

Every time a character’s tier increases, they gain an additional Attribute Point to allocate.

#### Investing into Archetypes

Every time your character gains a new tier after finishing a contract, you must invest that tier into a valiant archetype. These archetypes are similar to aspirant archetypes but have many more traits and abilities to select from, along with pools of archetype-unique abilities that you gain access to.

When your character reaches tier 1, you select their primary archetype, and gain the tier 1 trait or ability for one of that archetype’s classes. Then, as your character continues to grow, you can continue investing into the classes of that primary archetype or skip tiers in your primary archetype to select lower-tier traits or abilities from other archetypes (referred to as hybrid archetypes).

Comprehensive rules for investing into archetypes can be found in the Archetype Compendium chapter, along with all of the archetype traits and abilities.

  

#### Getting Your Hands on New Equipment

Contracts almost always come with a monetary reward and occasionally include more unique rewards such as equipment or resources. While the latter rewards vary greatly, the cash rewards follow a standard curve. In general, the pay from one contract of a certain tier will allow the purchasing of equipment for the next tier. Most valiants will have some Tin left over which they can use as they see fit.

The below table shows the recommended minimum Tin earned for a single character upon the completion of the listed tier. This sum of Tin allows for the purchase of a single piece of equipment for the next tier while having a bit of cash left.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Tier**|**Recommended Pay**|
|0|ƭ25,000|
|1|ƭ50,000|
|2|ƭ100,000|
|3|ƭ200,000|
|4|ƭ400,000|
|5|ƭ800,000|
|6|ƭ1,600,000|
|7|ƭ3,200,000|
|8|ƭ6,400,000|
|9|ƭ12,800,000|

#### Becoming More Well-Rounded

At every even tier, you can select another utility effect to apply to your character, similarly to the free utility effect at tier 0. As your character grows, you’ll gain access to more impactful effects. At higher tiers, each member of your company will become more well-defined due to their utility effects, and together you will (ideally) make for a well-rounded team of capable mercenaries.

### Establishing Your Company

Beginning at tier 1, you will have either established a formal company or organized an informal one. Both types are handled the same, having only a narrative difference.

### Starting Stories at Higher Tiers

Not all stories begin with fresh tier 0 aspirants. A story may explicitly start at a tier other than 0, or a group may wish to skip the first few tiers of a story. In these cases, players must create valiants that already have some amount of experience in the field.

#### Character Progression Condensed

If a story starts at a higher tier, players must create a tier 0 character, then increase their tier up to the desired tier. The character progression at each tier is done normally, with the character allocating Attribute points, investing in archetypes, and selecting utility effects.

#### Wealth at Higher Starting Tiers

Each character starts with a standard number of Tins for buying equipment, general items, or investing in company benefits. The game master may allow these Tins to be traded or pooled between characters, but normally players are not allowed to purchase anything that is of a higher tier than the starting tier.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Starting Tier**|**Starting Funds**|
|1|ƭ26,500|
|2|ƭ76,500|
|3|ƭ176,500|
|4|ƭ376,500.|
|5|ƭ776,500|
|6|ƭ1,576,500|
|7|ƭ3,176,500|
|8|ƭ6,376,500|
|9|ƭ12,776,500|
|10|ƭ25,576,500|

#### Established Companies

When starting a story at a tier other than 0, the players are already part of their own established company. Part of character creation then includes the defining of this company and establishment of existing supporting characters.

  

## 4.3 The Company

In addition to managing their own valiant character, players also have agency over their valiant’s company. Any player can contribute to the company and utilize its benefits. Companies have many general effects that influence both narrative gameplay and combat encounters.

### Company Establishments

Establishments are amenities that make valiants’ lives on the job easier. Establishments’ benefits are shared by the entire company. These establishments can either be purchased directly by valiants or rewarded to them during contracts. Establishments may be sold for half of their cost. Identical benefits from establishments of the same type do not stack.

Combat establishments have tiers that correspond to character tiers. The price of an establishments is equal to four times the price of an equipment item of the same tier.

Utility establishments give narrative benefits and are available at a flat cost.

#### Combat Establishments

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Establishment**|**Tier**|**Cost**|**Effects**|
|Dim Basement|1|ƭ80,000|Owners gain access to the following ability:<br><br>Spit Blood (1)<br><br>Reaction 2<br><br>_Counter_: Ignore all of the triggering ability’s effects, except for damage effects.<br><br>The dim lights really help cut down on cleaning costs.|
|Wilderness Retreat|2|ƭ160,000|Owners have Heartsense against each other during combat. This effect ignores effects that give Heartsense immunity.|
|Pub|3|ƭ320,000|Owners gain access to the following ability:<br><br>Strong Brew (2)<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Restore Guts equal to 5 plus your tier. You are Distracted.<br><br>Most valiants self-medicate, but can you really blame them?|
|Dojo|4|ƭ640,000|Owners may employ elite companion characters and bring them on contracts. These characters cost twice as much as normal characters to hire.|

|Workshop|6|ƭ2,560,000|When the owners begin a contract, each character may select a single Gear item that they own. That Gear item has its Limited value increased by 1.|
|Foundry|7|ƭ5,120,000|When owners begin a contract, each character may obtain one tiered Equipment item from this establishment. Obtained items must be at least 2 tiers below the obtaining character’s tier. These items are only owned until the end of the contract.|

|Artificery|10|ƭ40,960,000|When the owners begin a contract, each character may obtain a single artifact with them. Once during the contract, a character may consume their artifact to automatically succeed on a single check.|

#### Utility Establishments

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Establishment**|**Cost**|**Effects**|
|Store|ƭ125,000|When the owners begin a contract, they may obtain a general item. This item does not count against their general item limit and are only owned until the end of the contract.|

|Correctional Facility|ƭ1,500,000|Owners gain +1 on all of checks to maintain public order or keep individuals in line.|
|Headquarters|ƭ2,500,000|Owners gain +1 on all checks within the region that this establishment is based in.|
|Blacksite|ƭ5,000,000|Owners gain +1 on all of checks involving supernatural phenomena.|

  

### Hired Hands

As valiant companies grow, they will attract all manner of supporting companions. These companions range from powerful combatants to versatile assistants.

#### Companions

Companion characters are combat-ready characters that are employed by, or are otherwise allied to, the players’ company. They may join the player characters on contracts and assist them directly in combat. These characters are, however, subject to the same mortality as any other character, and can easily meet their end during a contract.

Companion characters are normal non-player characters and can either be controlled by the game master or a player. Players cannot normally take more than one companion character out on a contract at a time and can only bring companion characters of normal type. Players declare their companion character, if they intend to bring one along, at the same time as they declare the usage of other company resources during contracting.

The hiring rates for companion characters are given as a one-time cost equal two times the cost of an equipment item of the same tier.

At the game master’s discretion, companion characters can be modified by provisioning them with equipment items. The game master may also allow companion characters to tier up along with the player characters, or upon meeting certain conditions.

#### Assistants

Behind every effective team of valiants is a host supporting characters. These assistants don’t aid valiants in combat but manage various tasks to ensure jobs go smoothly. Assistants are almost always acquired as players meet and befriend helpful characters, expanding the capabilities of the company as the story progresses.

### Intel Points

All of the information your company has access to is abstracted as company intel points. These intel points can be earned from narrative events, downtime activities, or as rewards from contracts.

When selecting a contract, 2 intel points can be spent to reveal the number of combat encounters for a single contract along with the objectives in each encounter. This also reveals any field effects that may be applied to combat encounters.

When beginning a combat encounter, 3 intel points can be spent to learn the traits, abilities, and attributes of all non-player characters in the combat encounter. This is equivalent to using the Field Notes ability on all characters that are in the combat encounter or could enter the combat encounter. This does not reveal the number of specific character types that will be in the combat encounter.

Outside of combat encounters, intel points can be used to uncover narrative elements. The options for this are usually defined by the story and provided by the game master.

Intel points are not associated with any specific intel until used. This allows intel points to be used by players to retroactively learn information, pulling relevant knowledge from the abstracted library of intelligence they’ve accrued.

  

### Resource Points

All of the resources at your company’s disposal are abstracted as resource points. These points may be spent during contracting to allocate specific company resources to the contract. These resources offer various benefits throughout the contract for which they are applied

Multiple resources of the same type cannot be allocated to a single contract.

#### Standard Company Resources

|                        |          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource**           | **Cost** | **Benefits**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Blessing Token         | 1        | A fragile token protects you from harm. Once during the contract, when a disadvantage would be suffered, ignore that disadvantage. If the disadvantage is being applied to multiple characters, this prevents the application of the disadvantage on one of the characters.                                                                                                                                      |
| Faded Business Card    | 1        | Once per contract, you may use the contact information on this card to contact a mysterious stranger, The stranger will give you one hint or answer a single question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Quality Supplies       | 1        | Your superior provisions ensure success. Company characters are immune to the broken and tired disadvantages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                        | 2        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Entangled Radios       | 2        | A strange and transient corruption has affected your communications equipment. For the duration of the contract, company characters can always contact each other, even if some obstacle would normally make communication impossible.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Fresh Marching Gear    | 2        | New, high-quality gear makes travel easier and allows you to conserve energy. All company characters gain the Spirited advantage when the contract begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| A Way Out              | 3        | At any time during the contract, including during combat encounters, the team may use this resource to immediately end the contract without any penalty. This also gets them out of any combat or other predicament they are currently in.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cache Map              | 3        | Once during the contract, the team may grab some marked supplies. When you do this, all company characters gain the Extra Supplies boon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mysterious Fixer       | 3        | A shadowy contact ensures that your failures do not bring lasting consequences. If any character fails a check, any persistent negative narrative effects of that failure are rectified when the contract is completed.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Cosmic Intervention    | 4        | You, by some miracle, have garnered the goodwill of the stars. All company characters gain the Intervention advantage when the contract begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Cursed Idol            | 4        | This quickly fading effigy will surely bring ruin. During the next combat encounter, all enemy characters suffer a -1 penalty to ability checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Reinforcements         | 4        | Once during the contract the team may call for reinforcements as long as they have no active companion character with them. They may select one of their company’s companion characters to join them for the rest of the contract.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Artillery Support      | 5        | Once during the contract, any player character may use the following ability:<br><br>Call Ordnance<br><br>Slow Action<br><br>Area 4, Range 4-5,<br><br>All targeted characters take 4d6 piercing damage. This damage cannot be modified in any way and does not trigger effects normally triggered from dealing damage, dealing direct hits, or downing characters.<br><br>Who the fuck gave you access to this? |
| Experimental Medicines | 5        | You were promised these could work miracles… Once during the contract, while not in combat, these medicines can be applied to a single character to increase their valiance by 1. A character cannot benefit from this effect more than once per contract.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Special Delivery       | 5        | Once during the contract, you may pull some strings to gain immediate access to your personal stash. All company characters may swap any tool, supply, or equipment items in their inventory with items from their stash.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
