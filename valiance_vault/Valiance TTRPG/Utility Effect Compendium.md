# 8    Utility Effect Compendium

Any gameplay effect used exclusively outside of combat is referred to as a utility effect. These effects may give various bonuses to checks or allow characters to carry out specific narrative tasks. Many of these effects are intentionally open-ended and designed to allow emergent narrative gameplay outside of the rule-dictated heat of combat.

## 8.1  Obtaining Utility Effects

There are a handful of defined sources of utility effects, allowing players to define their character in a narrative sense as they build them. There’s also room for applying utility effects to characters outside of these pre-defined systems. Since utility effects are a softer mechanic, players should feel free to work with their game master to leverage this system in order to better define who exactly their character is, and how they fit into the story.

### Base Utility Effects

Upon creation, all characters will start with three or four utility effects. The first (or first two) of these comes from the character’s lineage. This effect is unlike almost all other utility effects defined in this document in that it is not necessarily a benefit to the character. Aside from this lineage effect, newly created characters also gain a utility effect from their chosen aspirant archetype, which can be seen as a sort of background for the character.

The last utility effect is a free effect chosen from the standard utility effect pools. Normally, a player is able to choose from the tier 0 global utility effects.

### Tier Progression and Utility Effects

On every even tier (2, 4, 6, etc.), a character gains a new utility effect. As with the free utility effect chosen during character creation, this effect is selected from the standard utility effect pools. This acquisition of an effect is done in the same way, except that characters will likely have access to a much larger pool of effects due to their higher tier.

### Effects Obtainable through Story Progression

Certain stories allow characters to gain story-specific utility effects. These may be gained by one or more character after meeting specific requirements laid out in the story document. The effects themselves are also defined in the story document.

  

## 8.2  Utility Effects

There are many utility effects defined for standard play. These range from bonuses to checks that use specific tools, to social bonuses a player can leverage. Additional utility effects may be defined by stories, or by players and gamemasters with a specific narrative idea in mind for a character.
