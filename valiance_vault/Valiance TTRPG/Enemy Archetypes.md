# 10  Non-Player Combat Characters

Combat characters in valiance usually take the form of a character, with a name and appearance wrapped around some generic stat block. Numerous of these generic stat blocks, across all tiers of gameplay, are defined in this section. There are also guidelines for building custom characters from scratch.

## 10.1        Creating a Combat Character

Combat characters roughly follow the valiant archetype classes: Artillerist, Distortionist, Warder, Analyst, Commander, Trickster, Fanatic, Sentinel, and Skirmisher. The names of the generic stat blocks consist of one or more class and any number of arbitrary descriptors. Generally, the names of simpler Normal characters will be much less complex than those of more rounded higher Threat characters.

### Combat Character Structure

The foundation of a character is its Threat tag; Normal, Elite, or Boss. In general, normal characters are worth ½ of a unit and bosses are worth 2, where the unit is an Elite character (as all player characters have Elite threat). A character also needs a Size tag to determine if it’s Small, Medium, Large, or Monstrous. This effects the number of tiles the character occupies.

#### Combat Character Attributes

A character’s attributes are defined in the same way as player characters’, getting 2 Attribute Points at tier 0 and gaining 1 more for every tier beyond 0. Certain base attributes may be increased or decreased, as well as the base Action and Reaction Points available to a character. Refer to the Threat tag definitions for these base value adjustments.

#### Combat Character Traits and Abilities

The Traits and Abilities of a combat character are distributed based on their Threat tag. Lower threats have less varied capabilities, while more powerful combatants have access to more Traits and Abilities. Combat characters also have access to every global ability.

The following table shows the recommended number of Traits and Abilities for characters of different Threat.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Character Threat**|**Number of Traits/Abilities**|
|Normal|1-2 of each|
|Elite|3 of each|
|Boss|4 of each|

  

## 10.2        Combat Character Sheet

Combat characters use a simplified character sheet for quick reference to their Attributes, Traits, and Abilities, along with their tier and character tags.
