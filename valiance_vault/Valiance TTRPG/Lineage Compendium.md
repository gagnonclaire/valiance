# 5    Lineage Compendium

All Archians (and thus all valiants) exist as some blend of the original tribes of the barrier, and their bloodlines give them certain strengths and capabilities. All people, regardless of the complexity of their family trees, display either a single dominant lineage or two co-dominant lineages. A person’s physical features and inherent capabilities are primarily determined by these dominant lineages.

## 5.1  Lineage Bonuses

Characters gain various bonuses based on their dominant lineage(s). These include traits and abilities from either one or two lineages, along the utility effects of any lineage from which they selected a trait or ability.

### Lineage Traits and Abilities

Each lineage has a pool of four potential traits and abilities. Characters with a single dominant lineage select two traits or abilities from their dominant lineage’s pool. Characters with two dominant lineages must select a single trait or ability from one of their lineage’s pools, and a single trait or ability from the other.

### Lineage Utility Effects

All lineages have a single attached utility effect. If a character has a single dominant lineage, they gain the utility effect of their dominant lineage. If a character has two dominant lineages, they gain the utility effects of both.

  

## 5.2  Cossim

Perhaps, though, they contain some deeper secrets… If you were able to discern the meaning of the patterns, you could surely learn something wondrous.|

  

## 5.3  Girt

Resourceful and calculated, the algorithmic mind of a Girt is a powerful enough tool to make up for their lack of physical prowess. On the modern barrier, Girt are the premier astronomers, architects, and merchants, though their means are more grounded and practical, rarely delving into the arcane.

It is more difficult for you to obfuscate facts without outright lying.|

  

## 5.4  Derge

A warrior people by nature, Derge are strong and stoic. Traditionally orderly, many Derge on the modern barrier find work as soldiers, guards, or physical laborers. The less traditional Derge, however, are often drawn to valiancy by the promise of glory. And, since they rarely live above 40, they are rarely concerned with an early grave due to a botched job.

## 5.5  Hjark

He still had a cavalry unit and a few gunners, more than enough to stage a counterattack.|

### Hjark Utility Effect

|   |
|---|
|Ingenuity<br><br>When presented with any machine, you are able to discern how it works and what it does given enough time. More complex machines require more time.|

## 5.7  Marr

Marr are a plain people, often overlooked upon the barrier. Still, they make up the majority of most modern civilizations, and it’s often because of them that societies run as smoothly as they do. Whether farming, building, or filling infantry boots, the modern barrier is simply full of Marr.

If you are away from a region you have adapted to for more than a season, you lose the adaptation.|

  

## 5.8  Selk

Desiring personal achievement worthy of a permanent legacy, it’s no surprise that the legends of the barrier are awash with Selk names. These legends, however, mostly concern brilliant leaders and revolutionary scientists, owing to the lineage’s sacrifice of physical prowess for mental fortitude.
