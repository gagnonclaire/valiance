### Gameplay Setup
Valiance requires one player to run the game and three to five additional players that each control their own character. The game focuses on these primary characters, following their experiences.

The players, the rules, and at least three six-sided dice are the only things strictly required to play Valiance. Supplements such as a physical or virtual tabletop, character sheets, and player journals are recommended to support more comprehensive gameplay.

### Rounding
In any case where calculations result in a fraction, the result is rounded down.
