# 6    Archetype Compendium

When one grows from aspirant to valiant, they specialize in one of three archetypes: Arcanist, Specialist, or Vanguard. Each archetype focuses on a different aspect of combat. Arcanists manipulate arcane energies to use abilities that affect large areas, whether it be to harm enemies or help allies. Specialists apply combat-wide passive effects and can utilize powerful targeted abilities to hinder their enemies or bolster their allies. Vanguards directly oppose their foes, focusing on engaging enemies on the front lines or using range and mobility to threaten key targets. Some valiants opt to invest into secondary archetypes, leveraging their combined strengths in hybrid strategies.

## 6.1  Investing into Archetypes

### The Aspirant Archetype

All tier 0 valiants, referred to as aspirants, are automatically invested into the Aspirant archetype. The character can select one Aspirant archetype class gaining all of the traits and abilities under that class. The character also gains a unique utility effect for use in narrative gameplay. Each character can only gain a single Aspirant class, as all future tiers will be invested into one of the three valiant archetypes.

#### Aspirant Origins

Every aspirant archetype includes a set of potential origins for characters of that archetype. These origins exist to aid in character creation and include various narrative hooks that can be used by the game master throughout the course of the campaign. These origins may be used as-is, built upon, or be replaced entirely by unique origins devised by players in collaboration with their game master.

All origins contain a brief background and a social connection. It’s recommended that custom origins keep it similarly simple. Details will emerge throughout play as all player characters have the following utility effect:

| A Past Life<br><br>There’s a lot packed into a life, more than could ever be known by anyone else. Once per contract, when you are attempting a check, you may establish a detail about your life before valiance and gain +1 to the check. This is added in addition to any check bonuses. The established detail becomes canon, though any bonuses it would give to future checks count as a utility effect bonus. |

  

### Primary Archetypes

At tier 1, an aspirant becomes a full-fledged valiant and must select their primary archetype. This will dictate that character’s primary role in (and to a lesser extent, outside of) combat. A character must select either the Arcanist, Specialist, or Vanguard archetype. They must then select a tier 1 archetype class gaining the tier 1 trait or ability for that class.

When investing into their primary archetype beyond tier 1, characters may choose any of their archetype’s classes at that tier, regardless of the classes they selected at lower tiers. Like tier 1, they then gain the trait or ability for that class at that tier.

#### Archetype Pools

Each archetype has a pool of unique abilities that they gain access to. Whenever a character invests a tier into their primary archetype, they may select a single ability from their archetype’s pool. This ability must be of a tier equal to or less than the character’s tier, and characters can only select a specific trait or ability from the pool once.

Arcanists gain access to the pool of Repertoire abilities. These abilities allow arcanists to target large groups of enemies with powerful (but costly) attacks or carve arcane hazards into the battlefield.

Specialists gain access to the pool of Strategy abilities. These abilities apply persistent, battlefield-wide effects that can entirely remold the tactical landscape.

Vanguards gain access to the pool of Technique abilities. These abilities, made up of attack modifiers and reactions, allow Vanguards to amplify their attacks and control the flow of battle.

### Hybrid Archetypes

Starting at tier 2, characters may opt to invest in a hybrid archetype. When investing into a hybrid archetype, a character skips selecting a class and pool ability for their primary archetype, and instead selects a class and a pool ability from those available in the other archetypes. The tier of the selected class and pool ability must be less than or equal to half of your character tier, and they do not have to be under the same archetype. The class and pool ability do not have to be from the same archetype.

Investing into hybrid archetypes does not disrupt a character’s investment into their primary archetype, and they can continue to invest into it as normal when they next tier up. For instance, a Vanguard character may take a Trickster tier 1 or 2 class, and tier 1 or 2 Repertoire ability at tier 4. Then, at tier 5, they may continue investing into Vanguard classes at tier 5 and gain a tier 5 Technique ability.

When investing into hybrid archetypes, characters may invest partially. They can take a class or pool ability from their primary archetype at their current tier, the other from a hybrid archetype at half of their tier.

  

## 6.2  Aspirant Archetype Classes

Aspirant valiants select one class from the aspirant classes, and gain all of the traits and abilities form their class as well as their class utility effect.

|Unwilling and Able<br><br>You’re much more capable than you’ve ever wanted to be. Your desires amounted to little more than a quiet, simple life. Reality, however, demanded that you be something greater. For most of your life you’ve begrudgingly played politics and management, but it’s time to find a more fulfilling way to provide for your family.|

It’s afraid but sane, and it’s probably the only thing keeping you functional.|
|Sufferer<br><br>If the gods exist, they are surely. You lost your parents before you even learned their faces. You’ve outlived the few childhood friends you’ve had. You dare not try your hand at romance. At some point in your life the sorrow evolved to anger. Now you want only to get even, though you’re not sure where to start. You just have to get the cacophony of voices in your head on board.|
|Witness<br><br>All you’ve ever done, and possibly all that you will ever do, are entirely inconsequential. You’ve glimpsed beyond this world and were broken by what you saw. You ego was replaced with the murmurs of something that you cannot comprehend.|

|Comfortably Numb<br><br>When you were younger you dreaded each day. It was always the same thing, day in and day out. At some point, something inside of you clicked. It was always the same. Every day. And that was just fine. Your coworkers were your only family. A cold and distant family, but a family, nonetheless.|
|Bureaucrat Wizard<br><br>You are one of the chosen ones: one of the few individuals who truly understand the inner workings.

Nobody else seems to get excited about this though, but your sibling hasn’t given up on trying to find you some friends.|

|Prize Fighter<br><br>A lifetime of training and dedication has made you a prized specimen.

|Martial Artist<br><br>To you, martial combat is an art form first and a tool second.

## 6.3  Arcanist Archetype Classes

Arcanists manipulate arcane energy to perform wondrous feats. Many modern comforts and gadgets are the result of generations of arcane experimentation and study.

For valiants, however, the arcane arts are a way to control vast swathes of the battlefield. Combat arcanists can conjure seas of fire and grand bolts of energy. The cleverer of these arcanists manipulate the arcane field in subtle ways to cripple their foes and bolster their own ranks. There is nothing more feared by common soldiers than a capable arcanist.

## 6.4  Specialist Archetype Classes

Specialists are tactical savants that directly manipulate the flow of battle. Whether it be neutralizing key threats, emboldening their own allies, or generally maintaining an advantageous position, specialists act as potent force multipliers.

### Analyst

The academic tacticians of the specialist archetype, analysts focus on consistency and predictability above all else. Though more common in the command tents of armies than in a team of valiants, some analytical minds do find themselves in the company of such mercenary adventurers. In combat, analysts attempt to create consistency rather than empower or disable and are instrumental in the devising of complicated battle plans. Without a competent analyst, even the best laid plans are subject to the arbitrary whims of the universe.

Vanguards are all manner of fighting folk that rely on physical prowess and trusty armaments to overcome their enemy. The tasks of a Vanguard range from holding a line to taking down dangerous targets.

### Fanatic

Fanatics are skilled Vanguards driven to frenzy at the mere thought of violence. They are feared on the battlefield, with their general lack of self-preservation making them a deadly force.
