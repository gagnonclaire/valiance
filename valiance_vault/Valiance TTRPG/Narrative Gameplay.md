# 2    Narrative Gameplay

The narrative systems of Valiance are often the first ones that players will interact with, as scenes are set, and characters are introduced. These systems tend to be much looser than combat and are focused more on collaborative storytelling and open-ended problem solving.

## 2.1  Scenes

In valiance, most narratives play out in scenes. Scenes are discrete and detailed glimpses into the lives and work of the player characters. There are many types of scenes, and the exact challenges, opportunities, and consequences can vary wildly.

In general, however, every scene includes at least one check called by the gamer master and at least one consequence. Some scenes, such as low-stakes downtime narrative scenes, may not include any checks and only minor narrative consequences. On the other hand, a field event scene almost always includes a check, and the corresponding consequences are usually applied to a future combat encounter.

### Types of Scenes

There are no hard categorizations for scenes, or limit on what they can and can’t be. There are, however, common scenes that will be played out repeatedly during adventures. These tend to follow a standard cadence, allowing for a certain set of expectations from the players and the opportunity to subvert those expectations.

#### Story Beats

Story beats are the most obvious and open-ended scenes. Every narrative has some plot that unfolds through its story beat scenes. These scenes are usually interactive, occasionally allowing players to make critical decisions. Sometimes these decisions go hand in hand with high stakes checks.

#### Contracting

The only scenes that almost always lack checks are contracting scenes. The purpose of these scenes is to dictate the terms of the players’ work. This includes objectives, pay, and allocated resources.

#### Field

Field scenes are the most structured scenes. These occur while on the job, often before combat encounters. They give players more concrete obstacles or opportunities and allow them to influence the contract’s combat encounters. They almost always have a check.

#### Downtime

Varied and unique, downtime scenes are defined by their activity. Some downtime activities involve checks for various rewards, while others are purely player driven and narrative.

  

## 2.2  Checks

Outside of combat, most confrontations are solved by making checks. These checks are made by the entire group, with bonuses gained by inspired collaboration and utility usage.

### Check Bonuses

Before rolling the check, every player must determine what they are doing to achieve the group’s goal. They can work in groups or individually, and every player making meaningful contributions gives a +1 bonus to the check roll.

#### Using Utility Effects

One way to achieve a check bonus is by finding a way to apply one of your utility effects to solve whatever obstacle the group is facing. This could be done as a single player explaining how their effects would aid the effort, or by a group of characters describing how their unique combination of effects would give them an edge.

#### Using Tools

A tool is anything defined in the Tools and Supplies subsection of section 2.4 Tools and Travel. In place of a utility effect, a player can make a case for how a tool or material may be used to aid in solving the problem at hand. Tools can only be used once per contract, and most materials are destroyed after being used.

#### Inspired Solutions

When a novel solution is devised by a player or a group of players, the group gets an additional +1 bonus to the check roll. This is applied in addition the individual +1 bonuses achievable by each character.

### Check Targets

When a player makes a check, they must meet or exceed the check target to succeed on that check. Check targets are almost always set to be relative to the impact of their resolution. Standard checks may give small bonuses or impose a slight disadvantage in an upcoming combat, while higher difficulty targets have more drastic effects.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Check Target**|**Difficulty**|
|**12**|Easy<br><br>Even groups with no bonuses have a decent chance at succeeding these checks.|
|**14**|Standard<br><br>Without some bonus to the check, characters will fail moderate checks far more often than they succeed.|
|**16**|Moderate<br><br>Even with bonuses, a decent amount of luck is needed to succeed on a difficult check.|
|**18**|Difficult<br><br>Very difficult checks are high stakes and require plenty of bonuses for even a chance at success.|
|**20**|Impossible<br><br>Even a player with a maximum check bonus is unlikely to succeed on an impossible check.|

  

## 2.3  Contracts

Most contractors know better than do any work without a contract. Thus, the first step for any valiant is to sit down with the client and construct a document to outline the work and, more importantly, the pay. For smaller companies, this process is usually mediated by a valiants hall, which provides legal resources and insurance in return for a small cut.

### Outcomes

The primary unit of work in a contract is the outcome. This refers to any exact, measurable effect the client wishes for. Importantly, contracts do not dictate how an outcome is achieved, only what must be achieved. For example, a contract may dictate that the head of a rival’s research and development department be neutralized. The valiants may take any number of potential paths to this goal, as long as the individual in question is no longer the R&D head at the end of the day.

#### Establishing Prime Outcomes

The prime outcome is the set of unconditionally required directives. For a contract to be considered fulfilled, and any payment allocated, all of the prime outcomes in the contract must be satisfied. It’s rare for contracts to come with more than one prime outcome, but not unheard of.

Before any other work is done on a contract, all parties must come to agreement on its prime outcomes and associated payment (often referred to as the base payment). If the contract is written under the guidance of the valiant hall, the hall’s cut will be determined at this point as well. For ordinary gameplay, the players won’t have to worry about this cut and can be presented with the payment they will receive in full.

### Amendments

Once a set of prime outcomes is determined, either party may apply amendments to the base contract. At this point, the prime outcomes cannot be changed. A contract is considered finished when all of the proposed amendments are either accepted or denied, and no parties have any further amendments to propose.

An amendment is any addition to a contract beyond the prime outcomes. They may be secondary outcomes with associated payments, resource allocations by the valiants’ companies, or any other manner of contractual obligations between the contract’s parties. For instance, the contracts written under the guidance of the valiant hall apply the payment of their cut as an amendment. This specific case is usually between the client and the hall, such that the players won’t have to worry about it.

#### Outcome Amendments

The most common type of amendments are additional outcomes that must be satisfied during the job. These come with an associated payment, but almost always also come with a penalty for failure. This penalty can range from concrete effects such as a monetary debt owed to the client, to more nebulous penalties such as a deterioration of relations.

The payments for amendment outcomes are only required to be made if the prime outcomes were satisfied. However, the penalties for failing to satisfy an amendment outcome are valid even if the prime outcomes were not satisfied. This makes outcome amendments risky for valiants to take on. Since primary outcomes have already been agreed upon, valiants are always able to deny outcome amendments without putting the contract in jeopardy.

  

#### Allocation Amendments

Larger jobs require more resources than a few hardy folks and some old weapons. Allocation amendments are contractual obligations to provide various resources to the contracted valiants to the end of completing the outcomes on the contract.

Allocation amendments may come from any party, but they are always allocated to the valiant company taking the contract on. It’s common for larger clients to allocate certain resources to the valiants for use during the contract, such as transportation resources. Valiant companies also commonly use these amendments to allocate resources from their own company. While it’s obviously not a requirement for a company to declare its own allocation here, many companies find it beneficial to set the resources aside as part of the contract.

For gameplay purposes, these amendments are where company resources are consumed to give advantages on the associated job. If the company resource is not declared as an allocation amendment, valiants cannot apply the resource’s bonuses to this job.

#### Miscellaneous Amendments

Any amendment to a contract that is not an outcome or allocation amendment is a miscellaneous amendment. These rarely have any impact on gameplay, but often serve to build narratives and add thematic flavor.

### Failing a Contract

Not every endeavor will be met with success, and it’s possible that the players will fail to meet a contract’s primary outcomes. This usually occurs when a team is forced to retreat after suffering unsustainable losses but can also occur when a team of valiants is completely wiped out.

#### Measuring Risk

Though it’s often impossible to tell exactly how many combat encounters a contract may involve, most contracts involve two or three required combat encounters. Depending on the contract’s amendments, valiants may have to engage in more combat encounters, increasing the overall risk.

Since a valiant only dies when their valiance reaches zero, the risk of death increases directly proportionally to the number of combats contained in a contract. It’s up to the team in the field to measure these risks and react appropriately. Clients are quick to forget nullified contracts, but nothing can bring a person back from death.

#### Tactical Retreats

When a field team makes the decision to abandon their current job, they nullify their contract. This doesn’t come with any contractual penalty and nullifies any penalties that may have been associated with outcome amendments. However, calling for a retreat means that the players will not receive any rewards from the contract.

Even a failed contract imparts experience, increasing the tier of player characters. They will simply have to make do with their current equipment when it comes to future jobs.

#### Total Loss

In certain occasions, a field team is utterly wiped out. If all player characters are killed during a contract, the game is over. Certain groups may wish to salvage the story with new characters in the same timeline, but generally a loss of a full team means the end of the players’ story.

  

## 2.4  Tools and Travel

Mortal conflict is only a small part of a valiant’s work. More often, valiants are sought out for their ability to quickly access remote and dangerous regions without arousing any suspicions. Thus, a valiant’s toolkit is much broader than their armaments, and includes tools both mundane and exotic.

### Tools and Supplies

Valiants rarely have any sort of support in the field, and its paramount that they prepare for every contingency. Even something as simple as a length of rope could be the difference between life and death in the remote reaches of the barrier.

#### General Supplies

Supply goods are any tools or goods that are generally useful. These are defined loosely to allow players to prepare for standard obstacles without having to explicitly pack exact tools before every contract.

Each character can only carry three general supply items.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|

|**Diving Equipment**|ƭ50,000|Diving masks, oxygen tanks, and other assorted equipment that can be used to brave the watery depths.|

  

#### Specialized Tools

Certain exotic or specialized tools aren’t included in those that can be acquired as general supplies. These usually include powerful arcane implements or cutting-edge power tools. While these may be more expensive, they trivialize certain difficult obstacles.

Due to the maintenance these tools require, each character can only take a single specialized tool with them on a contract.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Item**|**Cost**|**Notes**|
|**Soothe Stone**|ƭ1,000|A smooth, light stone that glows in soft hues of blue. The presence of this stone soothes all that bask in its soft light, making them generally more amicable.|

The wisp may also be deactivated by its activator at will and can be set to harmlessly self-destruct after deactivation.|
|**Arc-Comm**|ƭ100,000|A complex communication device driven by arcane entanglement. Pairings can be created between any number of nearby Arc-Comms, allowing them to transmit and receive encrypted messages at extreme distances, barring significant arcane interference or insulation. When an Arc-Comm is paired, all previous pairings are lost.|
|**Deepsuit**|ƭ250,000|An advanced diving suit utilizing advanced arcane tech. This diving suit is able to withstand pressures several miles deep and has built-in navigation and communication systems that are tuned to operate in extreme environments.|

  

#### Raw Materials

While it’s not often that a valiants needs raw materials while in the field, certain plans or strategies may call for some amount of bulk commodity.

Each character can only bring a single type of raw material with them on a contract. Each vehicle or pack animal brought along can carry a single type of raw materials item. A character that brings raw materials on a contract is assumed to have brought along enough materials for whatever they intend to use it for, barring cases that would require an extreme capacity of raw materials.

Most uses of raw materials will consume the materials used.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Material**|**Cost**|**Notes**|
|**Wood**|ƭ1,000|Simple lumber, useful for a multitude of things.|
|**Textiles**|ƭ1,000|Bulk cloths and fabrics.|

Some hypothesize that the substance is some sort of aberrant parasite.|
|**Perlim**|ƭ500,000|An extremely rare and valuable mineral, and one of the hardest materials on the barrier. Commonly used in expensive art and high-tech industrial processes.|
|**Primordial Heart**|ƭ750,000|Glowing stones that hum with power. With a proper setup, an endless stream of energy may be extracted.|
|**Genesis Alloy**|ƭ1,000,000|An advanced intelligent metal alloy extracted from the ancient genesis forges. It is incredibly strong and impossibly light, vastly outperforming even the most advanced and specialized modern alloys. The exact properties of the material differ in real-time, based on the current use case.|

  

#### Utility Upgrades

Utility upgrades are enhancements that can be applied to any individual item such as equipment items, general goods, and specialized tools. These upgrades augment items, giving them various non-combat bonuses.

Items can only have a single utility upgrade applied to them.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Upgrade**|**Cost**|**Notes**|
|**Self-Cleaning**|ƭ5,000|This item cannot be dirtied.|

This energy required to stow or retrieve an item in this way puts some mild, acute strain on the user.<br><br>While stowed, this item can only be detected by sophisticated arcane sensors or very skilled arcanists. You can stow a number of items in this way equal to your character tier.|

  

### Vehicles

During travel, the usage of vehicles can allow a team of valiants to carry more supplies and materials into the field. By default, a vehicle can carry a single player character’s worth of general supplies and raw materials. Some larger vehicles can carry more, as defined in their notes below.

Vehicles are assumed to have enough fuel or power for wherever a contract takes the team, barring certain circumstances such as extreme travel distances.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Vehicle**|**Cost**|**Notes**|
|**Pack Animal**|ƭ2,500|A mundane pack animal, such as a horse or donkey. Many pack animals can also be ridden.|

|**Air Transport**|ƭ2,500,000|Large aircraft, usually used to transport large amounts of goods. Can carry four characters’ worth of general supplies or raw materials.|

  

### Character Inventories

As outlined in previous sections in this chapter, there are limitations on the number of tools and supplies a character can bring with them into the field. To combat this, player characters have access to a few different modes of storage to make long-term planning more manageable.

#### Travel Inventories

The most straightforward player inventory is their character’s travel inventory. A character’s travel inventory is all of the items they have on their person.

This inventory is subject to limitations on how many items can be held. These limitations vary with item types, and are defined separately for tools, supplies, and combat equipment.

#### Stash Inventories

Stash inventories are long-term inventories. Each player character has their own stash, in whatever form it may take. Stashes have no limits on what can be stored in them but are not always accessible by a character.

Normally, a character always has access to their stash while not on a contract. While on a contract, a character’s stash access is determined by the game master. Usually, a character out in the field will not have stash access, while a character working an urban contract may have access to their stash depending on the situation.

#### Companion Inventories

Vehicles and companion characters have their own inventories, allowing them to carry tools and supplies for their player allies. These inventories are accessible to any player characters as long as those player characters have access to that vehicle or companion.

Vehicle inventory capacities are defined in the previous section. Character companions have a more limited capacity and are only able to carry one general supply item on their person while on contract.

#### Uncategorized Items in Inventories

Throughout the game, characters may acquire various items that don’t fall into any defined categories. These miscellaneous items are not subject to any standard limitations and may be held in any inventories.

In some cases, game masters may impose limitations on certain uncategorized items. This is usually to prevent a single character from carrying excessive amounts of items.

  

## 2.5  Combat Effects

Combat effects tie narrative gameplay to combat encounters by applying various effects to characters and the environment based on narrative events. These effects are either applied to a combat encounter as a whole or to an individual character.

### Field Effects

Field effects are applied to entire encounters and are capable of changing entirely how an encounter is approached. All characters in a combat encounter are aware of all active field effects.

Most field effects are unique, being defined within a story for each individual combat that has a field effect. Some examples are provided in this section.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Field Effect**|**Notes**|**Effect**|
|**Aberrant Intruders**|The balance of the world is born from a constant struggle amongst its various beings. It’s not uncommon for a particular group of these beings to rouse themselves to action against the rest of the world.|One or more aberrant enemy groups enter the combat as it begins. They are on their own team and enter combat alerted.|
|**Arcane Deadzone**|The utter lack of ambient arcane energy in the area imparts an unnatural lethargy.|When a character uses an ability with an Energy cost, double that ability’s Energy cost.|
|**Arcane Well**|Whether by natural phenomena or some grand event, the area infused with extreme amounts of arcane energy.|At the beginning of a character’s turn, they increase their Energy by an amount equal to 1 plus one fifth of their tier.|
|**Heavy Security**|Well-equipped private security troopers are responding to reports of sabotage.|One extremely dangerous Heavy Security Response team enters combat alerted when an objective is completed|

  

### Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages and disadvantages are potent effects that can shift the odds of battle. Many of these effects are applied for only a single combat encounter, though some persist for an entire contract. When a contract ends, all advantages or disadvantages on a character end as well.

If a character has multiple advantages or disadvantages of the same type, their effects stack.

#### Advantages

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Advantage**|**Effect**|
|**Cleansed**|During combat encounters, you are immune to all ailments.|
|**Extra Supplies**|When combat begins, gain an additional limited use of all standard gear abilities, then remove this advantage.|
|**Intervention**|When you suffer a direct hit, you may destroy the character that scored the direct hit then remove this advantage. This effect cannot be used against boss characters.|
|**Reinforced**|When you begin a combat encounter, increase your Guts by twice your tier then remove this advantage. This effect can increase your Guts above its maximum value.|
|**Resolve**|At any time outside of combat, you may remove this advantage and remove a single disadvantage.|
|**Spirited**|When you begin a combat encounter, increase your Energy by your tier then remove this advantage. This effect can increase your Energy above its maximum value.|

#### Disadvantages

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Disadvantage**|**Effect**|
|**Broken**|When you begin a combat encounter, suffer Withering equal to 2 plus twice your tier.|
|**Corrupted**|During combat encounters, you are immune to all boons.|
|**Out of Supplies**|During combat encounters, decrease the limited use of standard gear abilities by 1, down to a minimum of 0.|
|**Tired**|When you begin a combat encounter, decrease your Energy by 1 plus your tier.|
|**Wounded**|When you begin a combat encounter, decrease your current Endurance by 1. This effect cannot decrease your current Endurance below 1.|

  

### Afflictions

Afflictions are negative effects that persist on a character until removed. Single afflictions may only slightly affect a character, but when allowed to build up these effects can cripple even powerful valiants.

#### Standard Afflictions

Standard afflictions come with some severity _x_ that denotes how impactful that individual affliction is. If a character has multiple afflictions of the same type, their effects stack. The afflictions are still treated as separate afflictions when it comes to clearing them.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Affliction**|**Effect**|
|**Broken Bone [x]**|Suffer -x Lethality.|
|**Concussion [x]**|Suffer -x Energy.|
|**Diseased [x]**|At the end of every round reduce your Guts by x.|
|**Torn Muscle [x]**|Suffer -x Movement.|
|**Trauma [x]**|Suffer -2x Guts and -x Resistance.|

#### Removing Afflictions

The primary way to remove afflictions is via the Pull Yourself Together downtime activity, which can remove one affliction at a time. Other custom effects may remove afflictions, though they tend to be less reliable.

  

## 2.6  Downtime

Valiants tend to take plenty of time off between contracts, often due to the incredible physical and mental strain suffered during contract work. This time off can be used to rest and recuperate, pursue individual goals, or spend time with friends and family. Valiants are, under all of the trauma, still people.

Downtimes are taken on the scale of seasons, with at least one full season passing between every contract in normal play. Characters should have around two downtime seasons between contracts, with more or less given depending on narrative circumstances.

### Downtime Activities

All downtime taken by valiants fits under some defined activity. These activities can have all sorts of narrative and mechanical impacts, from making new allies to reallocating character growth. Activities are taken by individual characters, but multiple characters can group up for the same activity. In this case, each character makes their own checks, and the effects are applied separately. Character’s that don’t engage in a downtime activity can still tag along, but no effects will be applied to them.

Some activities have various difficulties that change their check targets. Characters may risk higher difficulties for increased rewards. Activities may also give varied rewards based on the tier of the character taking part.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Activity**|**Requirements**|**Effects**|
|**Acquire Resources**|The player must succeed in a relevant check to acquire general resources. The number of resources they gain is based on the selected difficulty:<br><br>·         **Standard**: 1 resource point<br><br>·         **Moderate**: 2 resource points<br><br>·         **Difficult**: 3 resource points<br><br>·         **Very Difficult**: 4 resource points|On a success, the player’s company gains a number of resource points that can be used to acquire specific resources.|
|**Collect Intel**|The player must succeed in a relevant check to acquire company intel points. The number of resources they gain is based on the selected difficulty:<br><br>·         **Standard**: 1 intel point<br><br>·         **Moderate**: 2 intel points<br><br>·         **Difficult**: 3 intel points<br><br>·         **Very Difficult**: 4 intel points|On a success, the player’s company gains a number of intel points that can be spent during contracting or in the field to gain additional information.|
|**Find a Hobby**|No requirements beyond time invested.|The player may swap out one of their character’s utility effects for another utility effect.|

TODO: adapt these for ability queues as well
### Activity Queues
All activities are queued in the order they are declared. While no activity is being raised by a player, the scene continues to play out as pending activities occur sequentially.

The result of any given activity is ultimately determined by the player running the game.

#### Impossible Activities
Some activities will become impossible between the time they are stated and the point at which they would occur in the scene. These are usually ignored, having no effect on the scene.

#### Adjusting Activities
Players may adjust their characters' actions as the scene plays out. This is effectively a new activity that can be declared and added to the queue. Depending on the current events in the scene and previously queued activities, the adjustments may be more or less effective.
