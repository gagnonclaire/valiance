Gear that makes you take piercing damage then empowers you. Clears the status when your guts are restored. Damage for half of current guts. Limited x gear
Continue to remove dependence on inter-character synergies
Clean up contracts section

Clean up all of the first few chapters
All function, no bullshit, if they want flavor they can read the archives

greatly simplify action resolution
standardize reactions

lot of things currently that are reaction but should be passive traits

No penalties for losing Valiance on a contract

Afflictions are individual disadvantages?
Should adv/disadv be team wide?

tiles with the breakable tag can be broken by targeting with any attack ability or an interact ability
if it's a tile face that target must be a tile that shares the face
breakable: this tile or a face connected to this tile may be broken
Archetype revision

Don't group archetypes under the three, they can all be their own
Move most pools into a common feats system
Allow multiclassing through the use of a repeatedly selectable feat (follows current rules for archetype restrictions)

recover, reaction 0, when your turn begins, end your turn and clear one of your ailments

allows the exists until removed ailment system without the weirdness of being caught out and staggered or something
also remove most cases of ailments that cam be cleared in nonstandard ways
rename grab cause it's not really a grab

hold?, stagger the targetÂ  if you are no longer adjacent to the target clear this ailment

Conditions for enemy character surrendering, like when they are staggered with no way out. Can be accepted by the party to speed up combat and save resources, or denied for fun

Mark mechanic
	character target abilities can only target a marked character as long as the user can see a marked character
	
character vs tile target
	like it sounds, abilities defined 'target character' or 'target tile'
		damage dealt to tiles is dealt to characters on that tile
			allow multihit for big characters?
	target: character
	target: self
	target: tile
	(etc.)

use hit points instead of stamina, energy point instead of energy
in general things that have current or variable values (hit points, damage points, etc.) are referred to as points

Strategies are used per round kinda like stances
	Should they just be stances? Could balance them cause you couldn't use both
	Strategies wouldn't be able to just be bonus shit, have to actually think about them and if a stance might be better

Make stances more general, changes gameplay round by round
	Enemy characters shouldn't be able to use stances or transforms (rename transformation)?
	Yeah that makes the gm job much easier, missing enemy stuff feels bad

buildups
	critical meter

Enemy rework:
	Instead of enemy characters have groups and actors that can fit neatly on an encounter sheet
	Abstract, much more than players
	Resources shared across team to simplify
	Act as one to speed up enemy turns
	power of abilities based on group, one member in range means all are when they use abilities
	Group traits and abilities that each member of a group has access to
	Individual members of a group then have their unique traits/abilities (usually only one or two)
	Turns based on groups, with the players being one of the groups? Or each player controls a group consisting of themselves and any of their allies (make allies more prominent? Like a company resource? They would play them in combat though gm would roleplay them, maybe reject insane orders)
	Group has defined reinforcements, specific member units that are good for continued pressure without being too oppressively (usually the more generic units of the group)
	Keep unit type designations, have to rework turns and ability economy. Probably make resources group wide and elites/bosses have some special thing 
	group stun effect that skips the group's next turn
	Turns taken in groups? As in all members of a group act simultaneously. Could work well with shared group resources such as available actions

Rename instant movement to be less cumbersome
field notes is a company resource?
All statuses are stacking, -1 stack at end of turn

rather than boosts use an advantage/fortune system? Like with adv 2 you roll 5d6 instead of 3d6 and take the 3 highest. Would alter the odds in a funny nonlinear way

targets:
	character - any character within range
	area - any character occupying the target tiles
	self - the character that used the ability

no "multiple sources of abilities" stuff, if you have two of the same ability you can still only use it once per turn. Two weapon fighting allows you to stack traits and mix and match other effects instead

Effects conditional on status
	"do x to an energized character"
	"do y to an energized 4 or higher character"
	"do z to an energized 3 or lower character"
	Can be used to impose soft caps on statuses, punish status stacking (by players or enemies), allow use of statuses as a resource ("")

Trait: The Save ability clears an additional point of the selected status

types of movement:
	move (standard)
	shift (instantaneous)
	forced (self-explanatory)
