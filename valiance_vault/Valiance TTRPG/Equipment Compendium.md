# 7    Equipment Compendium

Characters can wield and wear all manners of equipment, and they gain all of their equipment’s’ traits and abilities.

## 7.1  Equipment Basics

Though each type of equipment confers different types of benefits and are subject to different limitations, they share a few basic properties.

### Equipment Costs

The cost of an individual equipment item is determined solely by its tier. In general, the cost of equipment items doubles for every increased tier, with the exception being the reduced cost of tier 0 equipment.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Tier**|**Cost (ƭ)**|
|**0**|500.00|
|**1**|20,000.00|
|**2**|40,000.00|
|**3**|80,000.00|
|**4**|160,000.00|
|**5**|320,000.00|
|**6**|640,000.00|
|**7**|1,280,000.00|
|**8**|2,560,000.00|
|**9**|5,120,000.00|
|**10**|10,240,000.00|

  

### Carried Equipment

A character is limited to the equipment they can haul into the field during contracts. This carried equipment is selected from their stashed equipment and transferred to their inventory until the contract ends or the players otherwise gain access to their stashed equipment.

Every character can bring four weapon items, two armor set items, six accessory items, and six gear items with them into the field.

#### Combat-Ready

A character’s equipped items are determined at the beginning of a combat encounter. At this time, a player determines what weapons, armor set, accessories, and gear they are equipping for the encounter. Of these equipment types, only the equipped weapon items can normally be changed after the encounter starts, via the Equip ability.

Most non-player characters do not utilize equipment in the same way player characters do, and as such ignore equipping rules.

  

## 7.2  Weapons

Weapons are the primary offensive tools of characters in Valiance. When wielded by a character, all of a weapon’s abilities and traits are inherited by the character wiedling the weapon.

### Equipping Weapons

When a combat encounter begins, a character decides which weapons to bring into combat and which weapons to initially equip. A character may be equipped with either a single heavy weapon or one to two standard weapons. Equipped weapons items may be swapped out for other weapons during combat encounters using the Rearm ability.

### Base Weapons

Base weapons are generic weapon classes with various common traits and standard abilities. These can be obtained as tier 0 items, but also act as foundations for higher tier weapon items.

### Tiered Weapons

Tiered weapons are weapon items based off of one of the six base weapons. They inherit the same common traits and abilities as the weapon they are based off of, and have an additional traits or abilities attached.

## 7.3  Armor Sets

Armor sets are the primary defensive equipment employed by valiants and many other characters. Functionally, armor sets increase a character’s resistance, allowing them to take more punishment before receiving a direct hit.

### Equipping Armor Sets

When a combat encounter begins, characters may select one armor set that they have on them to be equipped for that combat. Normally, characters cannot change what armor set they have equipped after combat begins.

### Base Armor Sets

Like base weapons, base armor sets are generic tier 0 equipment items. Each type of base armor gives a defensive trait that increases resistance at the cost of some mobility.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Armor Set**|**Traits**|
|**Heavy Armor**|Heavy Armor<br><br>Gain Resistance equal to 2 plus half of your tier. Suffer -2 Movement.<br><br>If you expect to get hit with something heavy, you’d better be wearing something heavy.|
|**Standard Armor**|Standard Armor<br><br>Gain Resistance equal to 1 plus one third of your tier. Suffer -1 Movement.<br><br>You’d best put something sturdy on, lest a stray bullet hit something important.|

### Tiered Armor Sets

Tiered armor sets are similar to tiered weapons. They are based off of one of the two base armor sets, and have an additional trait or ability attached.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Tier**|**Base Armor Set**|**Armor Set**|
|**1**|Heavy Armor|Grenadier Suit<br><br>When you take damage from an Area Attack ability, you may double your Resistance when applying it to the damage dealt.<br><br>Watch out for that backblast.|
|**1**|Standard Armor|Hazard Suit<br><br>Ignore Hazardous tile damage equal to your tier.<br><br>The research team requested hardier equipment for their expedition. Provisions was more than happy to deny their request. When the research team failed to return, the engineers were fired, and the administration celebrated their success in cutting costs.|
|**2**|Heavy Armor|Razorplate<br><br>When an adjacent character targets you with an Attack ability, deal piercing damage to them equal to 1 plus your Resistance.<br><br>Protect the meek, punish the brash.|
|**2**|Standard Armor|Intrusion Suit (1)<br><br>Stance<br><br>Instead of taking a turn when your team acts, you may take your turn immediately after any enemy character acts.<br><br>At dawn, he’d ordered the intruder killed. By dusk, the intruder had struck him down.|

## 7.5  Gear

Gear items provide additional abilities to characters that equip them. These abilities range from supplemental damage sources to niche counters to various enemy strategies.

### Equipping Gear

When a combat encounter begins, characters may select two gear items that they have on them to be equipped for that combat.

### Standard Gear

Standard gear items are gear items that are available to valiants at no significant cost. They also do not count against character’s equipped gear items, so they can always be equipped (assuming a valiant can afford the extra weight). A character cannot carry multiple standard gear items of the same type.

Standard gear items have no tier, and their cost is negligible.
