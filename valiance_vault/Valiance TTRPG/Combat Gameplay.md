# 3    Combat Rules

In every contract, the narrative gameplay of Valiance will frequently be put aside to play a combat encounter. These encounters have much more strictly defined rules than narrative gameplay and serve as the primary moments of conflict during contract work.

Combat rules apply only to combat encounters and are ignored during narrative gameplay. Players may, however, use their combat capabilities as a basis for actions they perform via checks outside of combat.

## 3.1  Combat Encounters

When combat begins, the game master will present the players with a scenario consisting of the combat field, player objectives to be completed, and enemy groups contesting the players. As the encounter progresses, all three of these aspects may change and demand player adaptation.

Most combat encounters begin with all characters having all of their resources at their disposal. All characters being at their maximum Guts, Energy, and Endurance. All of their Limited abilities also begin with their maximum uses.

When the players complete their objective, the combat ends. It’s possible that the team fails in some way (such as death or retreat) and suffers a setback in their current contract. Sometimes, failure in a combat encounter can mean the nullification of a contract, even if the players survive.

### The Combat Field

The combat field is broken down into tiles, with each tile being a cube of some arbitrary size. These cubes can be empty or solid, and from these cubes the floors, walls, and obstacles of a combat field are built. The nature of an individual combat field can vary greatly, but most combat encounters take place in cramped spaces, where valiants have a natural edge over the larger forces they are confronting.

Generally, combat fields are designed so that a minimum of three valiants can comfortably fill the space and control key corridors. There will always be many more enemies than valiants, and control of the field is one of the few things keeping the players from being overwhelmed.

### Initiating Combat

When a combat encounter begins, the rules of narrative gameplay give way to Valiance’s combat rules. The game master will first present the field and objectives. Then, the players deploy their characters to their starting tiles and determine their starting equipment items. In some cases, such as enemy ambushes, player character positions will be determined by the game master. After deploying, the first round of combat begins.

#### Teams and Act Orders

The first thing to be established in combat are the teams taking part. Most commonly, these are simply the player team and the enemy team. However, more complicated encounters may have more than two teams. Once the teams are known, the act order must be established. Usually, the player team acts first unless a specific team has priority, such as during a surprise attack by an enemy team. After act orders are decided, combat begins.

  

### Rounds

During each round in combat, teams take turns acting. When a team acts, that team selects characters in their team to take turns. When a character ends their turn, the team selects the next character to take a turn and continues until all characters on their team have taken a turn. Then, the next team does the same thing until all teams have acted. After all teams have acted, the next round begins.

### Turns

During character’s turns, they may use action abilities in order to progress towards their team’s objective. After using their available action abilities, a character’s turn ends. Characters may also end their turn early, losing any available action abilities that have not been used.

#### Missing Turns

Certain effects may prevent a character from taking a turn during a round. If a character does not take a turn during a round, effects that would occur at the beginning or end of their turn instead all occur at the end of the round. Effects that would’ve occurred at the beginning of their turn happen first, followed by effects that would’ve occurred at the end of their turn.

Characters can opt to skip their turn. This must be done while their team is acting and before they have started their turn.

#### Simultaneous Turns

In certain cases, one or more character may take their turns simultaneously. When this occurs, those characters may use their action abilities in any order (though individual action abilities must still be used sequentially), and the turn ends when either all of the characters’ available action abilities have been used or all of the character’s agree to end their collective turn early.

  

### Combat Objectives

In a combat encounter, the player team will always have an objective that must be completed to either progress or end the encounter. Enemy teams usually just contest that objective, but they may also have their own objectives that the player team will have to contest while completing their own objective. If an enemy team completes their objective, it could make the encounter much more difficult or end the encounter outright, resulting in the loss for the player team.

Individual combat objectives are basic elements that can be used to create complex encounters. Completing one objective may end the combat or begin a subsequent objective. Some encounters may also run multiple objectives in parallel. The current objectives being pursued by a team are referred to as that team’s active objectives. All teams are aware of all active objectives during combat encounters, regardless of which team they belong to.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Objective**|**Description**|
|**Eliminate**|A team must down a specific enemy character.|
|**Control**|A team must control a tile group of tiles. Tiles count as controlled if the round ends and there are only allied characters occupying them.|
|**Escape**|All active characters on a team must leave the combat via any objective tile. When a character enters an objective tile or starts their turn occupying an objective tile, they may choose to leave the combat.|
|**Seize**|Any character on a team must use the Interact ability targeting an objective tile.|

#### Bonus Objectives

There are objectives in certain combat encounters that are not required for the combat to be won. Completing these bonus objectives may be required for certain contract amendments and can also alter the current combat encounter or have narrative consequences.

Normally, bonus objectives are failed if the combat is completed without completing that bonus objective.

#### Retreating

Certain combats may become impossible or unreasonable for the players succeed in. If an encounter is looking grim, players may opt to retreat. Doing so clears all of the player team’s current active objectives and adds an active escape objective to the combat. When this objective is completed, the characters escape the combat alive. Certain encounters are impossible to escape from.

#### Failing Combat Encounters

Combat encounters fail if the players are unable to complete their objectives. This can occur when all characters on the player team are downed, when the player team retreats from an encounter, or if a specific objective becomes impossible to complete. Enemy teams can have their own objectives that, upon completion, fail the combat encounter.

  

### Vision and Line of Sight

Both in and out of combat, most characters rely on their sight to see their surroundings. In combat, this becomes much more important as a character that cannot be seen cannot normally be targeted. Characters can normally only see lit tiles and cannot see characters in unlit tiles without alternate vision types. Tiles that are not naturally lit may be lit by various effects, such as the Lantern ability.

Characters cannot use abilities or effects from sources that they cannot see as triggers for their own abilities. Passive triggers, such as trait effects or the Protected status, are triggered regardless of whether a character can sense the source of the trigger.

To determine if a character has line of sight to a tile, draw a line between the centers of each tile. If that line does not cross through any solid tiles, the character has line of sight to the target tiles and anything in that tile. For characters that occupy more than one tile, line of sight to any of their occupied tiles is sufficient, and they may calculate their line of sight from any of their occupied tiles.

#### Heartsense [x]

The ability to sense characters’ positions regardless of line-of-sight. If an x is specified, this effect only works within x tiles from any tile the character with heartsense occupies. If no x is specified, the range is unlimited.

### Combat Knowledge

In a combat encounter there are several pieces of information that is implicitly known. This includes tile and character tags, direct hits suffered by a character in terms of missing Endurance points, and relative values for a character’s current Guts and Energy. Characters are also aware of all effects applied directly to them.

The relative values can be made visually apparent or given by the game master on request. The standard relative values used are: full, over half remaining, under half remaining (includes current values at exactly half), and empty.

A character must be able to see a tile or character to gain this knowledge, but no action needs to be taken.

  

## 3.2  Characters

In combat, all combatants are defined as characters with attributes, traits, and abilities. Almost every combat consists of two or more teams of characters, each with objectives that pit them against each other.

### Character Tags

All characters have tags that define their broad characteristics. These tags may confer various mechanics or interact with effects in certain ways. All characters are aware of the tags of any character they can see.

There are four categories of character tags: threat, size, type, and functional. All characters have exactly one size tag, at least one type tag, and any number of functional tags.

#### Character Threat

All characters have exactly one threat tag that defines their general combat power relative to other characters. This tag determines how many abilities a character can use during each of their turns, how many turns they take during a round, and the character’s base endurance.

Player characters always have the Elite tag. It’s important to clearly label non-player characters that have the Elite or Boss tag, as that can dramatically change how the players navigate the combat.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Functional Tag**|**Description**|
|**Boss**|A character with a 4 base Endurance and 10 base Energy. They gain 4 Reaction points every round, 3 Action Points every turn, and take 1 additional turn during every round.|
|**Elite**|A character with a 2 base Endurance and 5 base Energy. They gain 2 Reaction points every round and 3 Action Points every turn.|
|**Normal**|A character with a 1 base Endurance and 2 base Energy. They gain 1 Reaction point every round and 2 Action Points every turn.|

#### Character Size

A character’s size tag determines the tiles it occupies in combat encounters. All characters have exactly one size tag. Player characters have the medium size tag by default.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Size Tag**|**Description**|
|**Small**|A character that occupies 1 tile but are small enough to ignore various movement and engagement rules. Small characters ignore engagement, can move through tiles occupied by other characters, and tiles they occupy can be moved through by other characters.|
|**Medium**|A character that occupies a single tile.|
|**Large**|A character that occupies 8 tiles in a 2-tile cube.|
|**Monstrous**|A character that occupies 27 tiles in a 3-tile cube.|

  

#### Character Properties

Character Property tags apply standardized, persistent effects to a character. Characters may have any number of Property tags.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Property Tag**|**Description**|
|**Climbing**|As long as Climbing characters have an adjacent solid tile, they may act as if the tile below them is solid for movement purposes.|
|**Immobile**|A stationary character. Immobile characters are unable to move or move instantaneously and are immune to effects that would move them.|

### Attributes

A character’s attributes define their base capabilities. Attributes can be modified by various effects, such as traits or afflictions.

#### Reducing and Restoring Attributes

The Guts, Energy, Endurance, and Valiance attributes will regularly have their current value changed. If one of these attributes is reduced by an effect, such as damage reducing the Guts Attribute, its current value decreases down to a minimum of 0. If an attribute is restored by an effect, its current value increases up to its maximum.

Certain effects set an attribute to a value, which does not technically restore or reduce that value. This can be important when certain effects block restoration as a set ignores that restriction.

. These attributes have an implied current value that can be changed throughout combat without affecting their associated maximum value.

  

#### Attribute Descriptions

This table includes the base value and descriptions for all character attributes in Valiance. If an attribute’s base value has the format x + y, the variable x is the tier 0 base value, and the variable y is the value the base attribute is increased by for every character tier beyond 0.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Attribute**|**Base Value**|**Description**|
|**Endurance**|2|A character’s Endurance is decreased by 1 whenever they suffer a direct hit. When a character’s Endurance is decreased to 0, they are downed and removed from combat.|
|**Energy**|5 + 1x|In order to use an ability with an Energy cost, a character must have an Energy value equal to or greater than the Energy cost of the ability. After using an ability with an Energy cost, a character’s Energy is decreased by the cost of the ability.<br><br>A character’s base Energy is modified by their tier, where x is their tier.|
|**Guts**|10 + 2x|Guts is reduced by damage and Withering. When it reaches 0, a character suffers a direct hit, decreasing their Endurance by 1 and setting their Guts to its maximum value.<br><br>A character’s base Guts is modified by their tier, where x is their tier.|
|**Lethality**|0|Lethality is added to the direct damage dealt by Attack abilities.|
|**Movement**|5|During any instance of movement, a character can move into one tile for each point of Movement.|
|**Resistance**|0|Resistance is subtracted directly from any damage a character receives.|
|**Valiance**|2|Valiance is decreased by 1 whenever a character is downed during combat. Valiance can also be decreased directly outside of combat encounters at the game master’s discretion. Valiance persists across combat encounters until the end of a contract.<br><br>Only player characters have a Valiance attribute.|

  

### Traits

Traits are passive effects that influence every aspect of combat. Normally, the effects of a character’s traits persist for as long as they are in combat. There is no limit to the number of traits that can exist on a character.

#### The Valiant Struggle

All valiants have the Valiant Struggle trait, which allows them to survive otherwise impossible odds.

|   |
|---|
|Valiant Struggle<br><br>When you suffer a direct hit, you become immune to all damage effects until the beginning of your next turn.<br><br>Strength enough for one more try.|

### Abilities

Abilities are the actions that characters take during combat. All abilities have a set of tags and an effect. Together, these tags and effects describe how an ability is used, and what it does.

#### Ability Usage

While certain abilities may have usage modifications based on tags or other text, all abilities follow the same general resolution steps. First, a character uses an ability and declares this usage. After using the ability, the character declares valid targets if required by the ability. After targets have been declared, the effects of the ability occur against any targets that remains valid. This includes damage, the application of statuses, movement, or any other effects defined in the ability. After the effects of an ability have been applied, the ability has resolved. Unless otherwise stated, all of an ability’s effects are applied simultaneously.

During any of these steps, triggers may occur that allow other characters to use their own abilities, interrupting the original. When one of these interrupting abilities is used, the interrupted ability continues only after the interrupting ability resolves (or fails to resolve). Each character may normally use only one triggered ability per trigger. However, multiple characters can use the same trigger for triggered abilities. In this case, all of the abilities resolve simultaneously.

#### Action and Reaction Points

Action and Reaction abilities require points to be used. Action abilities require Action Points equal to the shown cost, and Reaction abilities require Reaction Points. When another ability effect triggers the usage an Action or Reaction, its point cost is ignored.

At the beginning of a round, a character regains all of their spent Reaction Points. At the beginning of their turn, a character regains all of their spent Action Points. The base number of Action and Reaction Points a character has is determined by their threat. As a valiant, player characters have the Elite threat tag.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Threat**|**Action Points**|**Reaction Points**|
|**Boss**|3|4|
|**Elite**|3|2|
|**Normal**|2|1|

  

#### Ability Checks

Ability checks work similarly to checks in narrative gameplay. When a player uses a check ability, and before they select targets, they roll 3d6. Based on the check outcome, the effects of the ability and even the valid targets may change.

To activate additional effects, you must meet or exceed the check threshold for that check effect. Only one additional outcome effect is applied. The check effect applied is the highest-level outcome effect that both exists on the ability and was met or exceeded with the check roll.

Bonuses for ability checks are primarily applied using the Assist Global Action. Bonuses to narrative checks cannot be applied to ability checks, only combat effects that explicitly give a check bonus are applied. Characters use their highest positive bonus and lowest negative penalty when calculating checks, not the total value of all bonuses and penalties.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Outcome**|**Check Threshold**|
|**Good**|10|
|**Great**|14|
|**Perfect**|18|

#### Ability Targets, Adjacency, and Line of Sight

Many abilities require a target. Any ability can target a title, and object, or a character, though most only have an effect on characters. Normally, a character using an ability must have line-of-sight to their target. When a character is targeted by an ability, they know the name of the ability that is targeting them. Abilities only require line-of-sight during the targeting step and can still resolve normally if is broken between targeting and resolution.

The user of an ability can only target themself with an ability if they would otherwise be a valid target, such as when the minimum range of an ability is 0. When a character targets a character that inhabits more than one tile, they target the closest occupied tile that they have line-of-sight to.

Certain ability effects require adjacency in addition or in place of ordinary targeting rules. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share a face, and two objects or characters are considered adjacent if they occupy adjacent tiles.

Most abilities with targets require a line of sight between the ability user and the target. Line of sight differs from a character’s passive ability to sense their environment. A character may be able to sense that another character is nearby without having valid line of sight for ability usage.

#### Abilities With Energy Costs

Many more powerful abilities cost Energy to use. If an ability costs Energy, the cost will be declared after its name in the format “Ability Name (x)”, where x is the Energy cost of the ability. Some abilities have a variable cost, where x is not replaced by a number (or x is an addition to a base cost). The cost of these abilities is decided by the user when they are used. Variable ability costs cannot be less than 1 (unless it is an additive cost), or greater than the user’s Energy.

An ability that does not cost Energy can have its Energy cost increased by various effects. In these cases, treat the ability as if it had a base cost of 0. Characters without enough current Energy to use an ability may not use that ability.

  

#### Altering Ability Tags

Certain effects change an ability’s tags. These effects are applied before the ability usage, even if the effect comes from that ability. These changes can be for a specific usage instance, or applied to all abilities that meet certain criteria.

#### Primary Ability Tags

Primary tags define how and when an ability can be used. Every ability has exactly one primary tag.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Tag**|**Description**|
|**Action [x]**|Active abilities that can normally be used by a character during their turn. Action abilities cost x Action Points to use. Unless otherwise stated, an individual Action ability can be used at most once per turn.|
|**Attack Modifier**|Abilities that augment Attack abilities, usable whenever a character uses and Attack ability. Normally only one Attack Modifier ability can be applied to an Attack ability. Only one instance of each unique Attack Modifier ability may be applied to a single Attack ability.<br><br>Attack Modifier abilities are not used, and their effects are treated as if they were effects of the modified Attack ability.|
|**Reaction [x]**|Reactive abilities that require certain triggers to be used. They can usually be used at any time a valid trigger resolves, costing x Reaction Points.<br><br>Counter triggers can be used whenever you are targeted by an ability. Global triggers can use any other ability usage or effect, including the start and end of turns and rounds.|
|**Stance**|Transient character modifier abilities that are used at the beginning of the round. The effects of Stance abilities are active until the beginning of the next round.<br><br>A character can normally maintain only a single active Stance ability.|
|**Transformation**|Permanent character modifier abilities that are used at the beginning of the round. The effects of Transformation abilities are normally active for the rest of the combat encounter.<br><br>A character can normally maintain only a single active Transformation ability.|
|**Strategy**|Combat modifier abilities that are used during combat deployment. Strategy ability effects are active for as long as the character that used the ability remains active in the combat encounter.<br><br>A character can normally maintain only a single active Strategy ability.|

  

#### Secondary Tags

Secondary tags apply to ability effects, standardizing common ability behaviors. Abilities can have any number of secondary tags.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Tag**|**Description**|
|**Attack [x]**|An ability that deals direct damage. Damage dealt by Attack abilities is increased by the user’s Lethality multiplied by x. If x is 0, the user’s Lethality does not increase the ability’s damage.|
|**Blitz**|An ability that has usage, targeting, and effect resolution steps that cannot be used as a trigger for other abilities or effects.|
|**Check**|An ability that involves a check, with additional effects based on the check outcome. The check is rolled after selecting targets and before effect resolution.|
|**Delayed**|An ability that does not immediately trigger its effects on usage. Instead, the effects and resolution are applied at the beginning of the user’s first turn during the next round.<br><br>Delayed ability usage and effects cannot be used as a Counter trigger.|
|**Limited [x]**|An ability that can only be used x times during a single combat encounter.|
|**Range [x]-[y]**|An ability that can target a tile or character from a minimum x to a maximum y tiles away, with 0 being the user or user’s occupied tile, given there is an unobstructed line-of-sight from the user to the target. If only one value is defined, that value is both the minimum and maximum range of the ability.|
|**Area [x]**|An ability that can target multiple connected tiles. Area abilities have an origin tile that is Range targeted. If the ability doesn’t have the Range tag, the origin can instead be any tile that the user occupies.<br><br>After selecting the origin, the Area ability user selects x additional tiles (the total affected tiles should be x + 1). These do not have to be tiles the user can see, but all tiles must be connected to the origin through a path of adjacent targeted tiles.<br><br>Some Area abilities target the tiles themselves, while others target any character occupying the target tiles. An Area ability can only effect a single character once per usage, even if it targets multiple tiles that the character occupies.|
|**Alteration**|An ability with effects that persistently alter the battlefield. Alteration effects from a single ability are unique, meaning a character can only maintain one instance of each of their Alteration abilities. If a character uses an Alteration ability while it’s effect is already present on the battlefield, the original effect ends.<br><br>A character may choose to end their existing Alteration ability effects at any time during their turn.|

  

#### Global Abilities

Global abilities are universal abilities that can be used by any character. These include fundamental abilities such as moving. dropping focus on focused abilities or making improvised strikes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Assist (1)<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Range 1-2<br><br>The target character gains a +1 bonus for their next ability check made during this round.<br><br>Need a hand?|   |
|Evade (1)<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Range 1<br><br>Move instantaneously to an unoccupied tile within range.<br><br>Thinking quickly is only valuable if you also act quickly.|   |
|Grab (1)<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Range 1<br><br>The target is Staggered. This ability cannot target characters that are one or more sizes larger than you. Staggered ailments applied by this ability are cleared if the character is no longer adjacent to you.<br><br>The brawler grabbed one of the horror’s strange appendages. She had no idea what this thing was, but it sure wasn’t going to be going anywhere.||
|Improvised Strike<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Attack 1, Range 1<br><br>Deal 2 damage.<br><br>The champion fell, not to bullet or blade, but to a swift kick from a disarmed soldier.||
|Interact<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Range 0-1<br><br>Interact with something within range, such as a door or objective tile. This ability can be used for any simple interactions not covered by other abilities. This ability can be used multiple times per turn.<br><br>The plan was simple: through the door coming up on her left, up the stairwell to the roof access, and lose the peacekeepers on the rooftops. She was arrested moments later, heavily concussed. The door was closed.||
|Leap (1)<br><br>Action 2<br><br>Range 1-2<br><br>Move instantaneously to an unoccupied tile within range. You cannot use this ability while engaged.<br><br>Don’t forget to check the wind.||
|Save (1)<br><br>Action 2<br><br>Range 1<br><br>Clear one ailment from the target character.<br><br>Get up! You’ll have plenty of time to die after we get paid!|   |
|Shove (1)<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Range 1<br><br>Move a target instantaneously 1 tile directly away from you into an unoccupied tile. This ability cannot be used while you are Staggered. This ability cannot target characters that are one or more sizes larger than you.<br><br>The realm was not saved by a mythical hero or experimental super-weapon, but a desperate push at a fated moment.|   |
|Sprint<br><br>Action 1<br><br>Move. This ability can be used multiple times per turn.<br><br>To be still is to be dead.|   |

#### The Valiant Gambit

All valiants have the Valiant Gambit ability, which has the potential to solve otherwise impossible combat scenarios. However, it just as often leads to an untimely death.

|   |
|---|
|Valiant Gambit<br><br>Reaction 0<br><br>_Another character’s turn ends_: take a turn. This turn does not count against your available turns for this round. When you use this ability, decrease your Valiance by 1. If this ability decreases your Valiance to 0, you are downed at the end of this turn. You must have at least 1 Valiance to use this ability.<br><br>A life is made to be spent.|

  

### Effective Character Counts

In combat, valiants often find that the odds are stacked against them. If they wish to survive the encounter, they must take on smaller groups of enemies or make use of combat field features.

#### Character Count Balancing

The strength of a team of characters is determined by their effective character count, which is in turn derived from the threat tags of characters in that team. When determining the effective number of characters, Normal characters count as half an effective character, Elite characters count as a single effective character, and Boss characters count as two effective characters.

A standard difficult encounter would see players taking on a total number of characters equal to twice their team’s effective character count. This almost never happens all at once, however, as in a standard combat encounter the game master will only actively be playing a number of effective enemy characters up to the player’s effective character count. This does not mean that enemies over that threshold cannot be made aggressive by poor decisions, only that the entire enemy force on a map will not instantly bear down on the players.

#### Enemy Reinforcements

A combat encounter will usually begin with an effective enemy character count equal to twice the players’ effective character count. The game master will actively play a subset of these characters in an attempt to stop the players from completing their objective.

As encounters go on and the original enemies are downed, additional enemy reinforcements will trickle in continuously. Depending on the scenario set up by the game master, this may happen at variable rates to give players a chance to pull themselves together and make objective progress.

#### Enemy Aggression

Enemy characters that aren’t being actively played by the game master are not unaware. If a player character targets them with an ability other than Field Notes or moves within their aggression radius, they will happily join the fray and even further turn the odds against the players. The standard aggression radius is 5 tiles from any tile occupied by the character.

  

## 3.3  Tiles and Movement

Combats take place on grids of cubic tiles. Normally, each tile represents a five-foot cube. Characters traverse these tiles to engage each other in combat.

When characters move, they must normally move to adjacent non-solid tiles. Adjacent tiles are only tiles that share faces. Tiles that share edges are not adjacent. When determining valid targets for range abilities, range is counted in the same way by traversing tiles across adjacent faces.

Movement can be done vertically as well. A character can move to the tile above or below them. Usually the tile below them will be solid and invalid, and the tile above has no solid tile below so the character will immediately fall back down. There are certain cases, such as swimming, where it is more practical for characters to move vertically.

### Tile Properties

Individual tiles have various properties that determine how characters and effects interact with them. These properties are defined as whether the tile is solid, and what tags the tile has.

#### Solid Tiles

Solid tiles are tiles that paths that cannot be pathed through. This applies to line of sight and movement. A tile can exist as a non-solid tile, a solid tile, or a tile with solid faces.

Non-solid tiles can be pathed through normally. If they have no solid tile beneath them, a character falls until they hit a solid tile.

Solid tiles cannot be pathed through, blocking both movement and line of sight. They cannot be moved into or occupied, and any line-of-sight path that passes through any of their faces is invalid.

Partially solid tiles have one or more solid faces but can be occupied as if they were non-solid tiles. Ordinary movement cannot path through any of the tile’s solid faces, and line-of-sight paths that pass through any of the tile’s solid faces are invalid.

Solid tile faces can be transparent, which allows characters to sense characters through the wall. This still prevents line of sight pathing.

  

#### Tile Tags

In combat, certain tiles can have additional effects beyond being spaces that can be traversed. These effects can be harmful or beneficial.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Tag**|**Description**|
|**Arduous [x]**|Arduous tiles are especially difficult to traverse. They cost x additional Movement to move out of but can be moved into normally.|
|**Breakable [x]**|Breakable tiles can be targeted as if they were a character. If x or more damage is dealt to them in a single instance, the tile is destroyed and becomes an empty tile.|
|**Climbable**|When characters are adjacent to a Climbable tile, they may act as if the tile below them is solid for movement purposes.|
|**Drop**|Drop tiles that are too inclined to be navigated by normal means. If a character without the Climbing tag enters one, they are moved instantaneously to the nearest valid adjacent tile of their choice, though they must prioritize tiles with no floor if such tiles exist. This movement bypasses any effect that ignores forced movement. When characters with the Climbing tag move into a Drop tile, they may choose to stay on that tiles as if they were a solid tile or continue falling.<br><br>Drop tiles do not trigger falling damage when they move a character, allowing the falling damage to continue accumulating.|
|**Fluid**|When a character moves out of a Fluid tile, they may freely move upwards or downwards.|
|**Hazardous [x]**|Hazardous tiles house some sort of immediate danger. Characters that begin their turn occupying a Hazardous tile or enter a Hazardous tile during their turn take x damage. Characters that occupy more than one Hazardous tile are only affected by the strongest Hazardous tile they occupy.<br><br>If a tile that has no solid floor would become Hazardous, the tile below it becomes Hazardous instead. This continues until the tag is applied to a valid tile.|
|**Obscured**|Obscured tiles that block line-of-sight. Characters cannot normally see into, out of, or through obscured tiles.|
|**Ramp**|Ramp tiles can be used to reach higher elevations without requiring additional Movement. Characters that occupy one also count as occupying the tile directly above it as long as that tile is not solid. This allows characters to freely move up to tiles above and adjacent to Ramp tiles.<br><br>If a character falls onto a Ramp tile, decrease the effective height fallen by 1.|
|**Soft [x]**|Soft tiles cushion falls. Characters that fall onto these tiles a freefall ignore up to x points of fall damage. If no x is defined, all fall damage is mitigated.|

  

### Standard Movement

Whenever a character may move due to an effect, such as the effect of the Sprint ability, they may move out of their current tile and into an adjacent one up to a number of times equal to their movement attribute. These movement instances happen sequentially, and every individual instance can be used as a separate trigger for reaction abilities or other triggered effects.

#### Engagement

When a character is adjacent to a hostile character that can sense them, they are considered engaged by that character. Characters that are engaged cannot move normally. Certain effects, such as instantaneous movement, avoid engagement and allow a character to disengage from enemy characters.

Characters must be able to see or sense (such as via heartsense) a character in order to engage them. Characters can only engage characters that are at most one size larger than themselves.

#### Instantaneous Movement

Instantaneous movement is a common variation of standard movement. Effects that allow instantaneous movement allow characters to effectively teleport to a specific tile. This movement ignores engagement, obstacles between the origin and destination, and ordinary movement restrictions.

Instantaneous movement effects targeting large or monstrous characters operate on a specific tile that the character is currently occupying. For non-forced instantaneous movement effects, such as those from the Evade ability, the character may select any tile that they occupy. The selected tile is then used as the origin point of the instantaneous movement, with the effect’s range counted from that tile. When the effect resolves, the chosen tile moves to the targeted tile, with the rest of the character moving along with it.

#### Forced Movement

Forced movement is a subtype of instantaneous movement in which a character is moved instantaneously by an effect, and they aren’t able to select the tile that they move to. This type of movement otherwise functions in the same way as instantaneous movement but can be influenced by various effects that explicitly change how forced movement works.

#### Moving Through Other Characters

Characters can move freely through allied characters that are not engaged but cannot end their movement in a tile occupied by an allied character. Characters cannot move through the tile of hostile or neutral characters.

If a character is ignoring engagement during their movement, they may move through allied characters that are engaged. If a character’s movement is interrupted while they are in an invalid tile to stop in, they instead stop their movement in the last valid tile they were in.

  

### Special Movement Types

There are several special movement cases that augment or circumvent standard movement rules.

#### Clambering

A character that wants to move up or (safely) down a steep incline will have to clamber. This movement moves the characters instantaneously from their current tile to a destination tile at the cost of 2 movement. A character can mount up to a height equal to their character’s height. For example, a Medium character can spend 2 movement to move a tile laterally and vertically in an instance of instantaneous movement. This allows them to climb a 1-tile high ledge.

Clambering does not require solid tiles under the destination tile, but the destination must be otherwise valid and unoccupied. It’s possible to clamber down a ledge, spending the additional movement to reduce the total fall distance by 1 tile. Clambering requires line of sight to the destination tile.

It’s also possible to clamber over walls and fences that are the same height as your characters. In these cases, the clamber brings the character through the wall or fence to the laterally adjacent walled off tile as instantaneous movement. In these cases, line of sight is needed to the tile above the one the characters is moving to, as if they were performing an ordinary clamber.

#### Falling

When characters falls a distance of one or more tiles, they take 2 piercing damage for each tile fallen. This is applied when they land on a solid tile, using their net vertical movement from the beginning of the fall to the end.

If a character falls onto a tile occupied by another character, each character takes half of the damage that the falling character would’ve taken. The falling character is then placed on the nearest unoccupied space of their choice.

#### Swimming

Sometimes characters find themselves in a fluid that they can swim through. In this case, a character may move upwards and downwards in addition to their normal movement options. Unless the tiles have tags (such as the difficulty tag) defined, no other restrictions are placed on swimming characters.

#### Squeezing

Characters that occupy multiple tiles can squeeze into smaller spaces, as long as one of the tiles they occupy is a valid tile. When such a character enters a smaller space from a full space during their turn, they lose an Action Point. When they start their turn in a smaller space, they gain 1 less Action Point.

While squeezing, larger characters’ occupied tiles that overlap with solid tiles are not counter as their occupied tiles.

  

## 3.4  Damage and Dying

In combat, most attacks do not result in significant injury. Bullets and blows can be deflected without sustaining any meaningful injury, but a combatant can only keep this up for so long before an attack finally finds its mark.

In valiance, a character’s Guts determines how much they can shrug off before their defenses fail and they suffer a direct hit. Many combatants can be taken down with a single direct hit, but more powerful characters can take multiple direct hits to incapacitate.

### Damage and Direct Hits

All sources of damage behave the same way when applied to a character. First, the source damage is determined, including any damage amplifying effects. Then, the character receiving the damage applies any special damage mitigating effects, and then subtracts their Resistance from the incoming damage to get the damage dealt (minimum 0).

The character’s Guts is then reduced by the damage dealt. If the character is left with 0 Guts, they suffer a direct hit from the damage. Even if 0 damage is dealt, it still counts as damage being dealt to a character and can trigger other effects.

If a single character takes multiple instances of damage simultaneously, combine all of the damage into a single instance before applying it as one source.

Direct hits reduce a character’s endurance by 1 and set that character’s Guts back to its maximum value. Since ability effect resolve simultaneously, all of the effects of an ability that scored a direct hit are applied before the target’s Endurance is decreased and Guts is set to its maximum.

#### Piercing Damage

Damage effects can be dealt as standard damage or piercing damage. Piercing damage, unlike non-piercing damage, is not reduced by the damaged character’s Resistance, though any special mitigating effects still apply. Like ordinary damage, it can result in a direct hit if it reduces the target character’s Guts to 0.

If a character takes both standard and piercing damage at the same time, the piercing damage is added to the damage dealt after Resistance has been subtracted from the original damage source.

#### Withering

Like piercing damage, withering ignores Resistance. It also ignores any special damage mitigation effects but cannot reduce a character’s Guts below 1. Thus, withering cannot on its own result in a direct hit.

Withering is dealt before any other damage calculations. After reduction due to withering is applied, then other damage types are calculated and applied in a separate instance. Withering does not trigger damage taken effects.

  

### Downed and Death

#### Being Downed

When a character’s Endurance is decreased to 0. Downed characters are removed from combat and, if they are a player character, have their valiance decreased by 1. Characters that are removed from combat are done so entirely. They can no longer have effects applied to them and cannot apply effects to other characters.

Effects that rely on a character existing, such as constant trait effects or engagement, end when they are removed from combat. Effects that are applied once, such as Alteration abilities and status application, continue to run their course after the character that created them has been downed.

#### Death

When an ordinary combatant is downed, it doesn’t matter if they are dead, dying, or otherwise incapacitated. They can no longer fight and are no longer an obstacle. It should not be assumed that a character downed in combat is necessarily dead.

Player character’s work on a stricter ruleset. When a player character is downed, their Valiance is reduced by 1. If their Valiance is reduced to 0, they die. This death may not be immediate, but it is inevitable and permanent.

#### Evading Death

If a player character’s Valiance was not reduced, but not reduced to 0, they are able to claw their way back from death’s doorstep. The player and game master are jointly responsible for building the narrative of their escape and subsequent reunion with their team.

Player characters that end a contract with less than their maximum Valiance suffer one Affliction for each point of Valiance they are missing. These Afflictions, defined in the Combat Effects section, may be selected by the game master, or randomly chosen.

  

## 3.5  Combat Effects

### Statuses

A Status is a temporary effect that can be applied individual characters during combat. They last until cleared by some effect. A single character can only have a single instance of each status effect.

Certain effects give status immunities. If a character is immune to a status, that status cannot be applied to them. If a character gains immunity to a status, it clears all instances of that status from the character. Complete immunity causes a character to ignore all effects that that it didn’t create with one of its own traits or abilities.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Tag**|**Description**|
|**Ailment**|A Status that negatively affects the character that it is placed on.|
|**Boon**|A Status that positively affects the character that it is placed on|
|**Stacking**|A status with a variable value associated with it. If a character would suffer a Stacking status while they already have a status of the same type, they instead increase the value of the existing status by the value of the incoming status. Clearing a Stacking status normally clears 1 stack of the status. If a stacking status has 0 stacks, the status is removed from the character.|

#### Boons

|   |
|---|
|Empowered<br><br>Boon<br><br>When the character uses a Check ability they roll 6 dice and choose the highest 3.|
|Energized [x]<br><br>Boon<br><br>When the character uses an ability with an energy cost they ignore then energy cost then remove 1 stack.|
|Frenzied<br><br>Boon<br><br>The character gains a +2 bonus for all ability checks.|
|Hastened<br><br>Boon<br><br>Gain an additional Action Point when you start your turn.|
|Invisible<br><br>Boon<br><br>The character cannot be directly targeted without Heartsense. Their location is still known, and they can be affected by Area abilities.|
|Protected [x]<br><br>Boon, Stacking<br><br>When you take damage, ignore the damage dealt and remove 1 stack.|

  

#### Ailments

|   |
|---|
|Blinded<br><br>Ailment<br><br>The character cannot target anything other than themselves or tiles they occupy unless they are using Heartsense.|
|Decaying [x]<br><br>Ailment, Stacking<br><br>The character suffers 2x Withering at the beginning of each of their turns, then 1 stack is removed.|
|Distracted<br><br>Ailment<br><br>The character cannot use Reaction abilities.|
|Exposed [x]<br><br>Ailment, Stacking<br><br>When targeted by a Check ability, treat the outcome as one level higher when applying the effects to the character. Then, 1 stack is removed.|
|Staggered<br><br>Ailment<br><br>The character cannot move or move instantaneously. This ailment does not prevent forced movement.|
|Taunted<br><br>Ailment<br><br>You do not benefit from ability check bonuses.|

### Effect Resolution

Effects that resolve at the same time have their effects enacted simultaneously. For example, if an effect would place an ailment on a character while another effect would clear an ailment, the character may have an existing ailment cleared but the new ailment cannot be prevented as it does not exist when the ailment clearing effect occurs.

The exception to this rule is changes to Guts. When applying reduction and restoration simultaneously, finish applying all reduction effects before applying restoration effects. During this intermediate state, an attribute may be reduced below 0 for calculations, meaning that large hits cannot be survived with a single point of restoration.
