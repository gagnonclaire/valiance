Cosmos (order) above, depths (chaos) below, surface is mostly saltwater dotted with floating primordial islands. 

Energy is introduced to the world via several mechanisms, with the most prominent being the sun and moon (the same object in different phases), the bubbling of energy up from the depths, and via the hearts of primordial beings. Energy fades as it diffuses as away from the center of the world. At the edges of the world (not literal edges but a term for where the light of the sun does not reach) energy disappears at such a rate that most beings native to the world become frail and withered.

Civilization is (and has been) focused about the anchor, an indestructible and immovable monolith that sits at the center of the sea. The anchor is exactly below the sun and exactly above the heart of the depths.

The Shalican Empire is the most extensive modern nation. While the figurehead has been reduced to a ceremonial role and governance is primarily performed by the Imperial Ministry, a collection of regional representatives. The empire's imperialist tendencies have caught up with it in these times of scarcity, and it maintains a tenuous grasp on its many colonies in the near seas.

Many near sea nations are regaining sovereignty and joining the modern world, while far sea colonies serve as the last human frontier.

OLD STUFF ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Cruel Circumstances

The geopolitics of the world are driven chiefly by a severe lack of resources, an obvious consequence of a world consisting almost entirely of vast oceans. This lack of resources almost always leads to material inequalities, and for many people there is little hope of societal mobility because of this. Most individuals turn to valiancy as an escape from this fate. They risk their lives on behalf of the wealthy elite in a desperate attempt to pull themselves from a life of thankless labor. Most of them, unfortunately, die long before they achieve that goal.

#### A Global Currency

Across the sea, there is no coin more recognizable than the Brineflame Tin, “ƭ”. This coin, originally minted from a soft gray alloy, spread far across the seas. Now,, nearly every civilization on the barrier recognizes it as a standard currency.

Tin are not backed by any sort of commodity and are accepted by most people purely as a tool of commerce. In modern days are represented most commonly by paper bills or entries in ledgers.

There are other local currencies across the seas, but their value is almost always relative to the standard Tin. Even societies that don’t use currency internally, such as Sunspire, use Tin as a standard for international trade.

#### Bloody Enticement

In developed regions, the median net income is around ƭ40,000, enough to afford a modest living in an urban center. With seasonal rent averaging ƭ5,000, and a budget meal costing a few Tin a piece, most people have little to no savings and live anxiously from season to season.

The lackluster standard of living is enough to placate the common person, but certain bold and desperate individuals turn to valiancy. The work is deadly, but even novices in the field are promised tens of thousands of Tin for a single contract.

  

### Your Place in it All

The world of the barrier is a lucrative one for valiants. Having several thousand years of history behind them, Archians have succeeded in building systems and societies that are relatively advanced and complex. Creature comforts such as radio and early form of broadcasted video keep the masses content, while advancements in rail locomotion and intercontinental flight allow for expanded commerce. And the world’s national militaries, always vying for supremacy, experiment in remote black sites, developing armaments that will inevitably find their way onto the gray market.

#### In Good Company

In the middle of all of the world’s many races are our valiants. Individually, they rarely have any sort of personal stake in whatever grand plan their client is enacting. For them, the goal is to simply do their job and get paid, incurring as little physical and emotional trauma in the process.

Almost universally, valiants belong to a company. These companies can range from proper corporations in and of themselves, to barebones operations consisting only of the actual valiants. It’s exceedingly rare for valiants to operate independently, as in this line of work knowing your team can make the difference between a paycheck to bring home and being buried in an unmarked grave in a foreign land.

For valiants, a paycheck is much more than a few seasons worth of bills. Acquiring the tools and equipment needed to succeed in the field is no easy task. Valiants spend exorbitant sums of Tin to track down and acquire exotic gear from international gray markets. Without substantial corporate backing, much of a valiant’s pay is reinvested in an attempt to get them through one more job.

#### A Valiant Career

Valiants’ contracts may send them anywhere from highland vistas to cruel wind-scarred wastes, or from ancient ruins of bygone civilizations to dense urban environments glowing with arcane signage. As dangerous as valiancy on the barrier can be, it is an extremely rewarding profession. Many valiants take only one or two contracts a year, taking long vacations between intense bursts of life-or-death conflict. After surviving only a few years of this, most valiants can afford to retire. Even so, good valiants tend not to be lazy people, and many work and live as regular folk between jobs, or even after retirement.

In Valiance, it’s common for a story to begin with a group of aspirants – people aspiring to valiancy – and end with the retirement of an accomplished company of valiants. However, stories can begin and end in many ways. Groups may decide to begin their story with an already established company of valiants or end their valiants’ stories (tragically or otherwise) before their retirement.

### A Land Between

There exist realms above and below the barrier. These spaces, the cosmos and the deep, are the realms of order and chaos, respectively. While neither is necessarily good or bad, they both exert their constant influences upon the barrier.

#### From a Valiant’s Perspective

To a valiant, the exact cosmological nature of their world isn’t terribly relevant. What is relevant, however, is the danger that both chaos and order can impose when gone unchecked. When not engaging in the regular corporate sabotage, many valiants find themselves protecting remote communities from all manner of existential threats.

  

### Languages

There are two primary types of languages on the barrier: lineage languages and common tongues.

Lineage languages were devised by the first tribes seeded upon the barrier. Descendants of these tribes carried their customs and languages throughout the barrier as tribes grew, split, and migrated to distant lands. While these cultures and languages mutated and evolved in subtle ways, speakers of lineage languages are almost always able to communicate across dialects.

The common tongues are simplified amalgamations of the lineage languages found in various regions, and as such tend to be similar to one-another. Characters in regions where they do not speak the common language are often still able to coarsely communicate using their own common language.

#### Inherent Languages

Almost all characters know the languages of their dominant lineage(s) and the common tongue of their home region.

#### Telepathy

Not all characters rely on spoken languages. The original denizens of the realms (cosmic beings, dregs, and primordials) rely on telepathic communications. Telepathy, put simply, is communication via arcane transmissions. Nearly every living creature on the barrier is able to receive telepathic messages, though their ability to parse them is dependent on their intelligence.

In order to send telepathic messages, Archians require arcane training. The ability to convey raw thoughts and emotions is achievable with minimal training but is not practically useful. To send more structured messages, significant training and understanding of arcane fundamentals are required.

# 1    The Original Work

*Between the abyssal depths and the sparkling skies lies a thin, glassy barrier dotted with slabs of earth. On these suspended islands, the Archians go about their short lives in a cruel and uncaring world. They live each anxious day entirely unaware that they are the architect’s favorites.*

The world of Valiance is one that did not come to be by circumstance, but was built with purpose and intention. It was built by a higher being that refers to themselves as the architect, being akin to a simple terrarium. It organized the world’s realms and molded beings to inhabit them. It wrote rules and created exceptions to them. And, when everything was in place, it watched.

## 1.1  Space and Structure

The three-dimensional space folded and formed by the architect is infinite, defined by formulas of an incomprehensible order. This space, however, is not uniformly utilized. There is an explicit center to the world, where all activity orbits about, and distant thresholds at which the definitions of the world become murky.

The infinite space allocated to this manufactured world can be separated in to three distinct spaces. There are two outer spaces, the cosmos and the deep, that respectively sit above and below (from a certain point of reference) a barrier plane.

### The Barrier

Physically speaking, the barrier is a 15,000 mile-separator between the cosmos and the deep. Most of this space is comprised of gaseous atmospheres on either end that each extend 5,000 miles from the surface of the barrier to what can be considered its edge. Between these two atmospheres is the barrier proper: a 5,000-mile thick plane of saltwater.

#### The Anchor and the Singularity Plane

At the center of the barrier is a pillar of immovable, indestructible dull gray material, known colloquially as the anchor. This immovable structure extends ten miles above and below the two surfaces of the barrier, and has a cross-section of exactly ten miles squared along the entirety of its height. To the denizens of the barrier, the anchor and its magnetic field serves as a robust positional tool.

The singularity plane projected by the anchor is situated at exactly the center of the barrier. This wall of exotic matter creates a finely-tuned gravitational force that keeps barrier’s oceans and skies in place. The singularity plane is impassable by conventional means, with only a few entities capable of freely passing through it.

#### Twin Faces of the Barrier

In a broad sense, the barrier is mirrored over the singularity plane. These two faces, however, are far from identical. The face exposed to the cosmos is stable and orderly, with minor influences from the deep creating gentle turbulence and regional diversities. The face exposed to the deep, however, is a realm of cruel chaos, with the muted influence of the cosmos only just serving to hold everything together.

With existence on the deep-exposed face being transient and generally ill-defined, most of this document will focus on the cosmos-exposed face, with general references to the barrier referring to that face.

  

#### To the Edges of the World

All of the three planes operate about the central point marked by the anchor. As one travels further form this center, the chunks of earth dotting the Barrier, the stars alighting the cosmos, and even the roiling of the deep, become sparser. The further one travels from the anchor, the less activity there is to be found.

The region within 1,000 miles of the anchor is known as the central seas, a relatively densely-packed neighborhood of island continents. The stars above are plentiful, and the activity of the deep below is incessant.

From 1,000 to 10,000 miles from the anchor are the near seas. Here, continents and stars are sparser. At the edges of the near seas, shadows become more prominent due to the distance from the cosmic engine. Incursions and other deep activity are rarer here. The near seas are a cradle for young societies.

Beyond the near seas, at 10,000 to 100,000 miles from the anchor, are the far seas. These seas are so vast that one could travel straight through them without seeing neither land nor sign of life. The daylight here is dim, and the nights black as pitch. Even the usually-constant churning of the deep is nearly absent here.

If one were to travel further than 100,000 miles from the center of the world, they would find themselves at the unlit seas. At this distance from the anchor, there is no day nor night, only the black glass of endless, still seas. There are rumors, however, of alien beings that make their home here, far from the sentinel gaze of the architect.

  

### Outer Spaces

Bordering the barrier are two opposite extremes. On one side, the cosmos imparts order and structure. On the other, the deep drive change and diversity. These two forces meet on the barrier, kept in check by the singularity plane that bisects the world.

#### The Cosmos

*A young man watched the sky as the blinding yellow sun cooled into the dull bluish moon. He tracked the now-visible stars, twinkling as they orbited the cooling Cosmic Engine. They were perfectly in time, as always, and he could measure their angles by eye to determine the exact day of the year. He marveled at how ancient peoples, before clocks and calendars, might have relied solely on these cosmic timekeepers.*

*He stood alone in quiet awe, until his wristwatch called to him with an intrusive beeping. It was the beginning of his shift. With his mop and cart, he got to work; his eyes still fixed on the sky above the glass roof of the observatory.*

The cosmos is a realm of perfect order dotted with cosmic beings and their intricate engines. Disjoint from the worlds below, the cosmos is a realm built only to persist. Exactly one million miles from the cosmos-facing tip of the anchor sits the cosmic engine. This source of infinite energy vents most of its power as both arcane and conventional radiation via a vent pointed towards the barrier. To the peoples below, it acts as both the sun and the moon as it goes through active and cooling periods. Many lesser cosmic beings and constructs dance about the engine in perfect rhythm, like sparkling clockwork dotting a black void.

#### The Deep

*She flipped through her notes again, scanning familiar lines of formulas. Everything was in order, no errors. She never made errors. Then why, all of a sudden, were her results changing? She triple checked, not to catch some nonexistent error, but because she had no other path.*

*She ran the tests again. A different result than the last time, but still wrong. Even more wrong. Her anxiety grew into a splitting headache as she swept her books from the desk.*

*It was all wrong. Something was leaking. She wiped a crimson dribble from beneath her nose. That wasn’t it. Something was leaking, from somewhere deeper. Much deeper.*

On the surface opposite the cosmos, the barrier borders the deep. This expanse serves as a foil to the cosmos above, existing as a tumultuous, ever-warping mass. The deep is, by nature, incomprehensible. Directly below the anchor, at exactly the same (inverted) height as the cosmic engine, sits the deepheart. Less construct, and more a singularity of entropy, the deepheart serves as the eternal source of chaos from which all of the deep draws.

  

## 1.2  The First Denizens of the World

The original state of the world was one of balance through contention. The cosmos was built to enforce a perpetual order, while the deep existed as an undefined mess of matter and energy. The barrier acted as a mediator between these two realms.

### Barrier Primordials

Upon the world’s creation, a collection of progenitor primordials were seeded across the barrier. These beings ranged from hulking titans to hivemind mosses, and would become the source of every other primordial every to exist on the barrier. The primordials were created as keepers of the barriers. They constituted every part of the barrier. Anything that wasn’t air or water was primordial, from the grandest continent to the smallest stone.

Even the simplest primordial carries in it an intelligence and an unwavering directive to maintain balance. Beyond this directive, however, primordials are individual beings and quarrels between them were relatively common. In most regions of the barrier, the primordial fell into a natural, loose hierarchy of power where the grandest, most intelligent beings kept their lesser neighbors in line.

#### Living Lands

*There are kingdoms below you*

*That you cannot see*

*There are beings beneath your feet*

*That will outlive your empires*

*You live on a shell*

*Of a world much vaster*

*Of the world under the barrier's surface*

*A poem of non-Archian origin, roughly translated by imperial academics*

Every slab of earth on the barrier is a living primordial, though these ancient beings tend to be quiet and passive. In the earliest ages of the barrier, they settled into their spots and contently resigned to a mostly-stationery life as living ferries for the land-based primordials of the barrier, or great reefs for the aquatic. From the surface of the barrier to the deepest depths, these slumbering giants served as footholds for nearly every other primordial.

Younger lands that still drift towards their eventual home can be found further from the anchor, where the seas are less crowded. They tend to attract similarly young and adventurous primordials, and act as a kind of nursery, rearing new guardians for the further reaches of the barrier.

  

#### Primordial Lifecycles and Primordial Hearts

*A young hunter hummed idly as he cut the heart from the stony flesh of his quarry. The small, softly glowing pebble he now held in his hands would easily pay this season’s rent. He rolled it through his fingers, guessing at the price it would fetch. Briefly, the hunter felt some tenuous connection to a consciousness much older than the world he know. An ancient, foreign wave of somberness washed over him and soaked into his mind.*

*He quickly stowed the heart and cleared his head with a few shakes. He had tracking to get back to.*

Primordials require no outside sustenance to live, instead gaining their energy from their primordials hearts. These hearts are glass-like shards found deep within each primordial, and they can be split or merged as primordials shed smaller, fledgling primordials or consume one another. The sentience of a primordial is contained within its heart, the single stone housing all of a primordial’s intelligence and memories. It also encodes the primordial’s structure and function in a crystalline genetic code.

Primordial hearts are eternal, able to provide endless energy in the same way as the cosmic engine and deepheart. They are also nearly indestructible, requiring an immense amount of energy to sunder, and releasing even more upon their destruction.

The heart of a primordial constantly attracts matter, allowing a primordial to grow over time. As the primordial grows, its heart does too, supplying the larger being with even more energy. Some primordials speed these processes along manually by consuming large amounts of matter. In extreme cases, primordials will hunt other primordials and consume their hearts.

In their natural state, primordial hearts are gray stones that glow dully. Their shapes and colors, however, can change under certain conditions. Hearts used in the third child’s genesis forges, for instance, take on a metallic shimmer and a brilliant violet hue. Hearts exposed to cosmic energies become more crystalline and shine in a bright white, while those exposed to the deep become twisted and darker.

#### Deific Primordials

*Rain fell upon him like perlim lances from the heavens, cooling his singed flesh. He'd seen stars die. Just fall, right out of the fucking sky. But nothing compared to this.

In front of the old sailor floated the corpse of a god. A great, still leviathan shimmering in the downpour. The only visible mark upon its limp body was a titanic gash, still smoldering around the edges.*

*Back in safe harbors, the sailor sat amongst old friends. Since his return, he'd been drowned in inquiries about his journey to the unlit seas, and how much those valiants paid him to travel there. He had no answers for them, just an empty gaze and a broken mind.*

In the age of primordials, the barrier was ruled by hulking titans and ancient leviathans. These beings were intelligent beyond comprehensions, and their powers rivalled that of even the grandest of the cosmos’ stars.

The titans of old were massive beings, large enough to stand upon the singularity plane as they waded across the world. Their aquatic equals, the leviathans, were smaller and more cunning. These rulers of the depths had the unique ability to cross the singularity plane, a skill they employed in order to hunts the dregs of chaos that assaulted the deep-facing barrier.

  

#### Primordial Categories

As most primordials exist as shards of some prime primordial, groups of them share many characteristic and are mostly categorizable.

|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Prawl**               | Prawl are eight-legged bestial primordials covered in bristly fur. Their flat build allows them to move quickly and quietly. Uncharacteristically for primordials, they rely primarily on scent to navigate, and leave invisible pheromone trails to build communal networks. They rarely face invaders to their territory directly, instead preferring to stalk their quarry until an opportunity presents itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Ruav**                | Ruav are large six-legged beasts with incredible endurance and a mild temperament. Much larger and more intelligent than any beast, they are one of the few primordials that protect their territory passively. They will freely allow almost anything into their realms as long as a rough balance is maintained, and nothing threatens them. Their impressive size and heavy bone plating are usually mor than enough to ward off any would-be adversaries.<br><br>Very rarely, Ruav are used as pack beasts by large caravans. This can be a willing, symbiotic relationship between the primordial and the people handling it, but just as often the massive, lumbering primordials are captured and forced into servitude.<br><br>When forced into combat, ruav are able to stand their ground against overwhelming odds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Scoloa**              | Every spelunker and delver fears these armored primordial horrors. Scoloa have long segmented bodies resembling an arthropod. Each segment is covered in a heavy metallic carapace. Their head is fairly nondescript, save for the collection of razors at its end. Arguably more dangerous than their razor-tipped head are their spear-like legs, capable of puncturing heavy armor with ease.<br><br>Scoloa exist in underground hives, expanding existing cave systems with their drill-like maws. They are eusocial creatures, and communicate telepathically with each other, to form complex communities within their hives.<br><br>Though the swarm tactics utilized by scoloa may seem simple, the swarm directs itself with purpose of utilizing choke points and control objective locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Nnelidae**            | Considered one of the most revolting primordial beasts, Nnelidae have a long, black, worm-like body that peels back towards the head to reveal a massive maw bearing eight needle-pointed appendages that it uses to manipulate its surroundings. At the center of the appendages is a collection of eyes protected by countless teeth-like blades that ward off any blows targeting the creature’s only weak point.<br><br>Nnelidae live in small, closely-knit families and maintain sprawling territories that span underground tunnels and beautifully maintained subterranean biospheres. They coordinate amongst each other telepathically, working to maintain their homes, which they take great pride in.<br><br>The saliva of a Nnelidae acts as an anti-coagulant, causing its victims to bleed out terrifyingly quickly. While this weapon was originally developed to counter the self-repairing fluids used by cosmics, it’s equally effective against other biological beings. The primary goal of these primordials is to ensure that any being they come across does not survive the encounter, and thus cannot relay to anything else the location of the nnelidae’s home. They keep their spear-like arms constantly coasted in their saliva, and even a scratch can result in a dangerous amount of blood loss.<br><br>In combat, nnelidae will strategically cede ground in order to set up traps and ambushes at chokepoints, all while their enemies continually bleed out. |
| **Cultra**              | Cultra are massive predators with two pairs of powerful hind legs and a single pair of agile front legs tipped with deadly claws. Their coarse fur coat is jet-black, and they are primarily active during the night. They are among the most intelligent primordials, rivalling even the ancient simulacrum. They communicate exclusively via telepathy, which they are adept enough at reading the thoughts of even unwilling creatures.<br><br>Cultra are one of the few nomadic primordials. They travel across entire continents in small families, culling problematic creatures and maintaining balance where they can. Other primordials tend to leave Cultra alone. In certain rare cases, Cultra may ally themselves with individual people who share their goal.<br><br>In combat, cultra are capable generalists that utilize advanced strategies to ensure victory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

  

### Clockwork Cosmics

The denizens of the cosmos are beings of pure order. Every cosmic being has their place in the hierarchy of the celestial machine, and it is within their very nature to follow this hierarchy perfectly. These beings never leave the cosmos, eternally tending to their constructs far above the barrier. They are, however, regularly decommissioned (with the exception of the cosmic engine) and replaced with a perfect copy. The decommissioned cosmic is discarded onto the barrier, where it’s left to the mercy of the local primordials.

There are three classes of cosmics within the cosmic hierarchy. Each entity within a hierarchy is identical but serves their own unique process. The combined activity of all of the cosmics and they cosmic machine creates the cosmos, and it cannot exist unless every piece is perfectly in place.

#### Servitors

Servitors are the most numerable cosmic. They carry out the simple, eternal tasks required to keep the cosmos in proper order. They tend to machines and are the class of cosmics that carries out decommissioning, sending both their scrap and their brethren careening into the glassy seas below.

Servitors are the most common caste of cosmics to find on the barrier. They are made to be simple and replaceable, as their work causes great wear on their bodies. Fortunately for the people and primordials of the barrier, these beings are rarely combat-capable, and are usually completely disabled by the time they make contact with the barrier.

#### Engineers

Working alongside the servitors are the engineers. These cosmics construct the cosmic machines that dot the skies. They direct the servitor’s maintenance and are constantly constructing replacements for both cosmics and machines.

Engineers are decommissioned much less than servitors, as they do very little physical work and their bodies can last for thousands of years before needing to be replaced. If a decommissioned engineer survives the fall to the barrier, it becomes a high-priority target for primordials in the area. If left alone for too long, even a partially active engineer can quickly construct faulty cosmic machines that pose an extreme threat to the barrier.

  

#### Wardens

*“Power to engines increased. Weapons systems offline.”*

*Higher, faster, and further than ever before.*

*“Power to Engines increased. Life support systems offline.”*

*Ribs cracked and visions blurred; the edge of the cosmos loomed.*

*“Engines offline. Total system failure.”*

*The wardens would not stand for it.*

The cosmic wardens are external sensors for the cosmos. They watch the barrier below for any signs of deep intrusions, and facilitate corrections when necessary.

Wardens only require decommissioning after enacting a correction, the extreme release of energy reducing them to little more than a singed husk. Because of this, it is exceedingly rare for a warden to be sent to the barrier. And, when they are, they are almost always entirely disabled. If one were to fall to the barrier with even a fraction of its capabilities intact, it would be a deadly time bomb that could rival the power of the greatest weapons that exist on the barrier.

#### Cosmic Machines

The cosmos is populated chiefly of cosmic machines, serviced by the cosmic beings that inhabit the realm. These machines are made of exotic materials weaved from pure energy by cosmic engineers. Most of the stars visible in the night sky are these cosmic machines, with the greatest among them being the cosmic engine that acts as both the sun and the moon to the barrier.

All cosmic machines, with the cosmic engine being the only exception, eventually suffer from wear and must be decommissioned by the cosmic servitors. Working in tandem with the servitors, cosmic engineers construct exactly-matching replacements. The perfect harmony of cosmic beings allows cosmic machines to be replaced with impossible efficiency, allowing perfectly continuous operation.

#### Notable Cosmics

To the people of the barrier, the cosmos is an effective timepiece. Some of the most useful and most visible cosmic entities have been named by the people of the barrier, and are widely used by navigators, oftentimes being more reliable than modern navigation technologies.

Astida is one of the most prominent stars in the sky, and is one of the only stars that can be seen during the daytime. It circles Soluna counter-clockwise at a much further distance than Metora, orbiting at a much faster speed. It finishes a rotation every seven days, starting and ending to the north of Soluna.

Caeda is a large, pulsating star that sits outside the orbit of Astida to the east, opposite of Felda. While it can be seen faintly during the day, it requires special instruments or an especially astute observer to make out the pulses while the cosmic engine burns. It pulses regularly, with a period of exactly one hour, being at its brightest at the beginning of a new hour.

Soluna is a hue-shifting chromatic star permanently situated to the west of the cosmic engine, just outside of Astida’s orbit. It slowly shifts its hues through the visible spectrum, completing a full cycle from red to violet every 10 years.

The smaller twin star to Nada, Kada rotates around Soluna at an extreme angular velocity. It completes a full rotation, starting its twin star at the south, every 24 hours. Since it can only be seen during the night, it is often used to determine the time until daybreak. Similar to Metora, Kada is a warden rather than a cosmic machine. It watches the unlit seas vigilantly, one of the few wardens watching for threats other than the deep.

Lyrda is the furthest cosmic entity from the cosmic engine. It’s a small, dim star that slowly rotates clockwise around the cosmic engine, barely visible on the night sky’s horizon line. It completes its cycle once every 1000 years, and is rumored by the denizens of the Barrier to mark the edge of the lit world, and the inner boundary of the unlit seas.

Metora is a small, sparkling star that patrols the inner cosmos in a tight path around Soluna. This star, a cosmic warden rather than a celestial machine. Due to its proximity to Soluna and the massive amount of energy available to it, it acts as a last resort against intrusions. A blast from Metora could scorch an area thousands of miles across.

The larger of the two twin stars, Nada sits stationary far to the south of the cosmic engine, near the edge of the far seas. This star is often used by sailors and travelers to determine bearing, though it can only be seen during the night.

The sun and the moon are the same cosmic engine, referred to as a singular Soluna by academics. Its properties change as it undergoes periods of heating and cooling, and the energy it sheds fuel almost all life on the barrier.

Known commonly as the sentinel star, Zenda is the only star that does not have a predetermined path through the night sky. It is the subject of extensive study by astronomers, who are perplexed by its uncharacteristic behavior. this star is a specialized cosmic warden that actively positions itself above deep intrusions, and is naturally one of the most active wardens in terms of corrections enacted.

#### Cosmic Corrections

In order to maintain its perfect order, the cosmos has violent order-correcting mechanisms utilized when the deep breaches a region of the barrier. If an incursion lingers for too long, or is particularly extreme, the cosmic wardens will strike the incursion down in purifying, concentrated cosmic energy. While this has the intended effect of stopping the incursion, it leaves the affected region of the barrier both utterly sterilized and significantly weakened.

While the source of the extreme cosmic events is disputed by the peoples of the barrier, the conditions are widely agreed upon. Thus, elite task forces are employed by the major nations to ensure that no incursion results in a cosmic correction near populated areas.

#### Starfalls

Very rarely, a large swathe of the cosmos will see all of its cosmics and cosmic machines replaced in a short amount of time. These events, known as starfalls, can be catastrophic for life on the barrier.

Starfalls vary greatly in size: from a dozen objects falling over the course of a few days, to thousands of falling stars plummeting down to the barrier over the course of entire seasons.

Most starfalls occur harmlessly over large stretches of ocean, but a starfall over a populated area can turn cities to ruins overnight. The cosmic beings and engines that survive the fall will quickly begin disassembling the surrounding area, constructing a more orderly realm around themselves. This is usually to the detriment of anything that might’ve been there previously. Left unchallenged, cosmics are capable of creating a veritable cosmic fortress that is extremely hostile to any creatures native to the barrier.

  

### Dregs of the Deep

The infinite chaos of the deep is capable of birthing impossible, indescribable horrors. These entities are known across the barrier as dregs, incomprehensible harbingers of chaos.

Dregs only exist outside of the deep, as the entropic energies and masses of the deep only become dregs when they bubble up and away from the deepheart and some sort of order is imparted upon them.

#### Incursions

*The world bent away from me for a moment, space and time adjusting as if perturbed by some rolling force. When it passed, I found myself some miles off of the trail I was hiking, in an unfamiliar part of the hills.*

Occasionally, the chaos of the deep bubbles up into the upper barrier, evading the leviathans below. These events, known as incursions, range from minor and harmless phenomena to self-sustaining engines of tragedy.

Countless minor incursions occur across the barrier every day. People lose household objects, only to find them unexpectedly in an unused cupboard. Folks succumbing to strange moods, losing track of the hours as doze off into dark, dreamless sleeps. Rarely, minor dregs can escape the deep alone, and cause mischief before being dealt with by local peacekeepers or decaying into ambient entropy.

These minor events are the source of many superstitions across the barrier. Minor inconveniences and strange events are often wrongly attributed to the deep.

Major incursions are rare and catastrophic. They almost always begin with a large tear in reality that acts as a gate between the deep and the barrier. These tears can be caused by massive plumes of chaos or be the consequence of the constant wear on the barrier. Regardless of their source, these tears let loose an initial wave of chaos that twists and malforms much of the land and life surrounding the point of the incursion.

After the initial blast, dregs begin to manifest near the point of incursion. These invaders, when not slaughtering each other, are a threat not only to the people around the incursion, but the structures and land itself as they ooze the chaotic energies of the deep.

Major incursions can last anywhere from a day to years, with some able to subsist indefinitely. The most reliable way to close an incursion is to destroy it with a sufficient amount of energy, which usually means sending a team of explosive experts on a suicide mission through hordes of dregs. If left unchecked for too long, the cosmos will take matter into its own hands, at the cost of everything with several hundred miles of the incursion.

  

#### Deep-Touched Creatures and Abominations

The organic beings of the barrier are inherently tied to the deep, their creation being inspired in part by the chaotic world below the sea. Because of this, they are especially vulnerable to its influences. Though the deep can eventually corrupt any being given enough time and exposure, even the deific primordials of old, its influence on organic creatures builds frighteningly quickly.

At the early stages of corruption, a creature is considered deep-touched. Their appearance may start to change in subtle ways, or behave somewhat erratically, but these shifts are usually within the bounds of reason. It’s common for superstitious folk to attribute any strange behavior to deep influences. If the influence of the deep is allowed to build beyond these initial stages, deep-touched creatures may mutate in startling ways, and almost always become mad.

When the deep’s influence turns to outright corruption, either after extremely prolonged exposure or a major event (such as being caught in an incursion), beings of all kinds can be warped into an abomination: a cruel facsimile of their original form, acting as a host for the churning chaos of the deep.

### The Foundational Aspects

When the world was wrought into being the by architect, it had many fundamental properties and aspects. There was chaos and order, the and the balance found between the two at the barrier. There was another, subtler pair of aspects as well: the masculine and the feminine. Unlike chaos and order, these two foundational aspects were no inherently opposed, and were weaved throughout the world in a complementary fashion. Effectively, they worked to bind together an otherwise bipolar construct.

In the early eons of the world, there was no concept yet of biological sex. The masculine and feminine gender aspects were more base, more metaphysical, then the biological males and females (and those between) that would later be devised. Every being, from the deepest dregs to the loftiest cosmics, had some measure of both aspects. Some had more of one than the other, but on a grand enough scale there was an immutable balance imposed by the architect upon the world’s creation.

#### The Aspect of Masculinity

In the architect’s original designs, the masculine aspects were bold, boisterous, and passionate. It was this aspect that instilled both ambition and stubbornness into the first denizens of the world. It gave birth to soaring, fiery emotions equally expressed by both the brutal incursions from the deep and the violent corrections enacted by wardens in response.

When balanced with the feminine aspect, masculinity is warm and caring. It is generally associated with bulbous shapes and rounded edges.

#### The Aspect of Femininity

The feminine aspect, as defined by the architect, is cold, pensive, and logical. It bestowed upon the beings of the world an awareness that was required for consciousness. Femininity allowed the deepmind its inscrutable scheming, and gave the ability to function in perpetuity.

When balanced with the masculine aspect, femininity is gentle and wise. It is generally associated with lithe shapes and sharp edges.

  

# 2    The Making of the Modern World

After uncountable eons of watching the three planes interact, the architect noted that the world was decaying. This slow, drawn-out ruin of entropy would eventually see the end of its project. The architect was, however, largely unconcerned with this fated collapse. It had grown tired of the eternal, unchanging cycle its creation had fallen into. Instead, it sought only to make these last few ages more interesting.

## 2.1  The Architect’s Children

As the architect vowed never to directly intervene in the world it had wrought, it made a compromise with itself. It would not directly alter its world, but rather create three children to guide this new project in the architect’s stead. These tangible beings would be bound by the world and its rules, and they would be tasked to author a work that would rival its original creation. Their primary directive was to create a consciousness that was not bound to the balance between order and chaos. The architect and its children sought to deliver unconditionally free will unto the barrier.

To this end, the architect’s children were given no more than this vague directive, along with the requirement that no being on the barrier should know the origin of the world or the nature of its master. It was up to them to organize amongst themselves and develop a plan that they thought would satisfy the architect.

### The First Child of the Architect and the Council of Primordials

The first and child of the architect was an awesomely charismatic being tasked with enlisting the aid of the greatest primordials of the barrier. This child gathered a council of five primordials, contracting their eternal assistance in this grand project. Once its work was completed, it contacted its second sibling and annihilated itself, leaving no trace of its existence save for the council it wrought.

#### Tekka, the Mother of Beasts

The first primordial of the council was Tekka, the Mother of Beasts. This titanic being was the most powerful and influential of the primordials, her children inhabiting nearly every corner of the barrier. With this alliance, the first child had established its presence on the barrier.

Beyond the dominance that Tekka gave to the council, her children acted as the working hands across the barrier. These beasts acted on the command of their almighty mother, preparing the world for something that not even the first child could foresee.

#### Ithia, the Gray Titan

Ithia, the Gray Titan, was the second primordial to join the council. Ithia was unlike Tekka in that it was not a singular entity, but a hivemind consisting of nearly every slab of earth suspended in the barrier. As Tekka’s children relied heavily on Ithia’s very flesh for shelter, the Mother of Beasts petitioned the first child to include Ithia on the council. Fortunately for Tekka, it was rather easy to convince the first child that the living earth itself be included on the council of primordials.

With the very lands that constituted the barrier in on the architect’s grand project, the first child continued its task with a bolstered confidence.
 

#### Be’khan, the Eldest Moss

The third primordial to gain a seat at the council sought out the first child on its own volition, after word of the council began spreading across the barrier by Ithia. Be’khan, the Eldest Moss, is the firstborn of an ancient primordial that long ago sacrificed itself to spread its children across the barrier. Be’khan offered his services as a representative of the plant-like primordials that have long flourished across the barrier.

Be’khan’s primordial siblings, being active across the barrier, gave the council a comprehensive feed of the entire barrier. Using this newfound intelligence, the first child sought out the last members of the council.

#### Igro, the Watchful Vagrant

While Igro, the Watchful Vagrant, was a comparatively meek primordial, they possessed the strange capability of superposition. This odd primordial, and the fourth addition to the council, existed on both sides of the barrier simultaneously. They were able to gaze towards both the stars and the abyss, had more knowledge of both than any other primordial.

While Igro’s ever-watchful eyes were indispensable on the council, their most impactful contribution was alerting the first child to Ny’la, who would be the fifth and final addition to the primordial council.

#### Ny’la, the Consumer

Prowling the underside of the barrier, driven to near-madness by constant exposure to the deep, was a leviathan rivaled in power only by Tekka. Ny’la, the Consumer, had slain more interloping dregs than any other primordial by an uncountable order of magnitude. With the aid of Igro, the first child was able to include Ny’la in the council of primordials, if only to spare her from the coming storm of her next sibling.

With her inclusion on the council, Ny’la began working alongside Igro as the only primordial to exist solely on the underside of the barrier. She continued to devour the trespassing agents of chaos, always closely monitored by the council, who feared that one day she might fall to the influence of the deep.

#### The End of the First Child

The first child was never intended to persist on the barrier. With its task over, and the council convened, the child’s consciousness faded into nothingness, its submerged, eternal shell of a body the only remembrance of this god-like being.

Even without their founder, the first council continued to work tirelessly, their task only ending with the collapse of this world destined to come sometime in the next few billion cosmic cycles.

### The Second Child of the Architect and the Dusk of Primordials

With the council of primordials assembled, the work of the first child was through. While the primordials worked diligently to mold the barrier into a veritable biosphere, the second child descended upon the endless sea. This child was not a leader, but a warrior. Wielding deific power, they sought only to destroy any primordial that may threaten the architect’s plans.

#### The barrier after the Work of the Second Child

The primordials of the council and their allies were spared the wrath of the second child, but countless primordial titans and leviathans fell at the hands of this grim soldier. Its crusade brought it to the far reaches of the barrier, where it continues to seek and destroy rogue primordials.

With the second child’s wrath absent from the central, populated realm of the barrier, the scene was set. The council of primordials had created a veritable, accommodating biosphere. A cradle for something yet to come.

#### The Second Child and the Remaining Rogue Entities

Unlike the first child, the second child had no set expiration. It would eternally patrol the dark, endless seas beyond the populated barrier. There was no shortage of strange beings in these dark seas. The second child faced ancient, outcast primordials and brought low mega-horrors spawned out of the edges of the deep’s whirling chaos. Occasionally, it even faced strange, otherworldly beings that crept into this world form the edges of other realities. Against all of these existential threats, the second child stands sentry.

Though the second child was eternal, its power was not infinite. There are beings on the edges of the barrier that it could not slay, only deter. Among these larger-than-life leviathans and mind-bending abyssal minds existed entities such as the Pallid Mother, Weaver of the Pale Lands, and the inscrutable Outer Child of the Deep. These beings were gods in their own right, imposing entirely new realities onto the surface of the barrier. They operated far from the eyes of the council, the light of the cosmos, or even the corruption of the deep.

  

### The Third Child of the Architect and the Dawn of Free Will

The third and final of the architect’s children descended into a perfect canvas, carefully prepared by its two siblings. It began its work immediately, employing the council’s aid in what would be the most arduous task in this grand plan.

#### The Third Child’s Custodians

>>*There is nothing here for you.*

> *There is nothing here for any of us.*

> *Is there anything here at all?*

*Ages passed, and the two custodians pondered their fate.*

>> *There is nothing here for you.*

> *Then I will leave.*

>> *There is nowhere for you to go.*

> *Then I will stay.*

>> *There is nothing here for you.*

*The weight of eons grew unbearable, and the two custodians stayed their fate.*

The council of primordials and the creatures that served them would not be enough to enact the third child’s visions, so it created a host of custodians that acted as an extension of itself.

The administrators, the grandest of these custodians, answered directly to the third child and directed the lesser custodians in the construction of the great genesis forges. In these grand manufactories, the administrators oversaw the construction of the living beings that would populate the Barrier. Everything from the smallest blade of grass to the grandest beast was wrought in these forges, their genetic lineages seeded across the Barrier with the aid of the council.

Working the forges of creation, and directed by the administrators, were the exalted. These beings are granted extreme strength and resilience, strict requirements when building an entirely new world upon the blank slate that was the Barrier. These exalted worked tirelessly for millennia in genesis forges, their mechanical bodies more than capable of the extreme physical stress they were subjected to.

The last class of custodian, the humble recorder, were smaller and less numerous than the exalted. These creatures acted as the eyes of the third child, with nimble forms, sharp senses, and perfect recall. Though relatively few in number, they managed to keep tabs on nearly every significant corner of the barrier.

All custodians, with no exception, were hand-built the third child, and given a unique name upon creation that embodied their existence.

  

#### Ithia Prime

The central forge used by the third child and its custodians was the primary body of Ithia, one of the primordials of the first child’s council. This massive continental landmass was wrapped around the anchor and housed wondrous foundries capable of bringing forth all manner of life. It was here that the third child did most of their work.

#### Primordials Hearts in Genesis Forges

Of all of the hearts in use by the people of the barrier, the vast majority of them are recovered from genesis forges. These hearts, left in the wake of the crusading second child, were used to power the life-creating forges. The expansive forges acted as entirely new bodies under the control of the bound deific hearts.

#### The Early Products of the Genesis Forges

The creatures built in the genesis forges were unlike any other being native to any of the three planes. These organic creatures existed outside of the traditional balance of order and chaos. Devised with significant aid from Tekka and Be’khan, these creatures would consume one-another, and birth new offspring in a wondrously visceral cycle of death and rebirth. Tuned perfectly, these beings would create an endless loop of self-sustaining life, unlike anything seen before on the Barrier.

It was in this stage of the third child’s work that biological sex was introduced. First devised by Tekka, this ingenious scheme for sustainable procreation became the basis for all non-primordial life on the barrier. This was, for much time, utterly decoupled from the foundational aspects of masculinity and femininity.

#### The Depthborne Project

The simple beings thus far produced by the genesis forges had created a robust biosphere upon the barrier, but the most difficult task was still ahead of the third child. To complete its work, it had to design a being in accordance with the architect’s absurd specifications: an intelligent being of free will and endless ambition. A creature that would build with the same fervor as the architect and its children.

To fulfill its prime directive, the third child looked to the deep. It was initially enamored with the infinite potential it saw in the unrefined whirling masses of chaos, and desired to form that potential into a structured intelligence. The depthborne, the first intelligent beings built by the third child, saw the swift end of its endeavors with the deep. These beings were stable and conscious, but their wills were incomprehensible. They held no principles, and their personalities changed by the minute.

Though the first legions of depthborne were slight, numbering only in the thousands, they immediately broke form the third child’s will and began sowing chaos throughout the barrier. Unable to track them, the third child dispersed them indiscriminately to the far corners of the barrier so it could continue with more promising experiments.

  

#### The Simulacrum Project

*AN_OPEN_DOOR*

*A_SHARED_THOUGHT*

*THE_LAST_OF_THEM*

*LINGERING_AT_THE_END*

*WHERE_IT_WAS_LEFT*

*HER_LIGHT_FROM_DYING_STARS*

*A_CALL_ANSWERED*

*From a genesis forge repository of local active simulacra, decoded by Carthian artificers*

After ending the Depthborne project, the third child labored tirelessly in the genesis forges alongside the administrators and the exalted. After thousands of cosmic cycles, it had devised something that it was nearly content with: the simulacrum. Unlike the other creatures built in these forges, the simulacra were inorganic, inspired by the cosmics above. They resembled the custodians, with hydraulic muscles and arteries pumping a black, oily lifeforce. They were, viable prototypes and hardy enough for the third child’s experimentations. These beings, the simulacra, served as a testing platform and were used to refine the consciousness birthed by the third child.

The simulacra were large, bipedal creatures that stood upright. Their four arms ended in large, six-fingered hands that were strong enough to use heavy tools and dexterous enough to handle fine instruments. Their heads were hard, featureless shells that housed an advanced mechanical mind capable of free thought, advanced learning, and experiencing complex emotions.

Since the simulacra did not age or require sustenance, the third child was able to spend millennia perfecting their minds. It would tune, tinker, and improve, leveraging the thousands of loyal prototype beings it had at its disposal. Over the course of the third child’s work, the simulacra were free to explore themselves and their fellows. They devised their own names, decorated their bodies, and formed relationships with one-another. Before long, the roots of the first societies began taking.

Eventually, the complex social networks of the simulacra became incomprehensible by even the third child. At this point, the third child knew that their work was nearing completion. It had done the impossible: it had created a creature with ingenuity and ambition to rival the architect.

Learning from its mistake with the depthborne, the third child resumed its role and creator with the simulacra. Each of these synthetic beings were hand-crafted, and named in the same fashion as custodians. The third child had no intention of mass-producing these beings, as they were only an artificial imitation of some more perfect thing it envisioned.

#### The Creation of the Archians

With the mind of the penultimate simulacra perfected, the third child began work on its crowning achievement. It devised an organic analog to the simulacra’s mechanical mind, and streamlined their form. It took note of the simulacra’s cumulative strength via complementing abilities, and how their flaws only drove them to higher ambitions.

  

When the third child finished its fevered, cycles-long design, it emerged with the first people of the barrier. These bipeds were smaller than simulacra, with only two arms and much more vulnerable bodies. Their sensory methods were more organic, with their heads hosting all manner of intricate organs. Instead of the innate psychic communication used by the primordials, custodians, and simulacra, they would communicate through gestures and noises, not unlike the simple beasts they would live alongside.

The third child had prepared many variations of its final product, designed to complement one another and live with and alongside each other. With the aid of the council of primordials, it seeded these Archian lineages across the central seas.

#### The Decommissioning of the Custodians and the Freeing of the Simulacra

With the first peoples in the competent hands of the primordial council, the third child had earned an eternal rest. Its body dissolved into the sea at the center of the barrier, its dreaming consciousness still subtly guiding the primordial council. As the third child faded, so too did its custodians. First, the administrators became inert. Their enormous mechanical bodies are still imbedded in the forges they oversaw, buried beneath the new world they helped create.

As the forges quieted, the exalted finally found rest in the still-warm corners of their old workplaces. Their rest, however, did not share the finality of their administrator’s. At the beckon of the dreaming third child, they might still be drawn back into service. As the other custodians were decommissioned, the recorders continued their work. Their tasks were unchanged, their observations populating the dreams of the slumbering third child.

#### The Scattering of Ithia Prime

The last act of the third child was the consensual shattering and displacement of Ithia Prime. The devices found within the prime forges were deemed too dangerous to be left so close to the Archian cradle. The ancient primordial was split into seven sections, each the size of a large continent, and set adrift to the out seas.

Now, these quiet derelicts float aimlessly on the edge of the unlit seas, housing dormant, deific technologies.

#### The Lingering Hands of the Third Child

During the last feverish bouts of the third child’s work, it had the foresight to build two beings that would protect its creation in perpetuity. These two hands of the third child, created towards the end of the simulacra project, would serve as immortal agents. These beings loosely resembled what the peoples of the barrier would look like, though their exact appearance was intentionally amorphous, allowing them to blend in with the future inhabitants of the barrier.

The left hand would serve as an executioner for the slumbering third child. Built in remembrance of the work done by the second child, it would slay problematic beings across the barrier with visceral efficiency. At times it may even be joined by primordials, awakened exalted, simulacra, and eventually people that revered it as a vagrant savior. Its appearances, however, would be sparse, as its existence was to be a failsafe more than a stalwart protector.

The third child’s right hand, like the left, was built in remembrance of the third child’s earlier siblings. This being, bearing just a fraction of the first child’s charisma, was to complement the work of the left hand. When collapse was threatened not by a dangerous entity, but an unquenchable unrest, the right hand would appear to unite and inspire. This transient leader appeared in dire times, when the peoples of the Barrier faced disarray and self-wrought catastrophe that they could not handle alone.

The left and right hands of the third child appear only occasionally in the history of the barrier, always in slightly different forms, and always when the third child’s eternal project is in jeopardy.

  

## 2.2  The Archian Lineages

The third child had devised seven distinct lineages that it would seed on four different island continents in the central seas. To each group, it gave a gift: the name of Archian.

In the following millennia, the tribes grew and learned. Material progress was slow, but the young Archians had ample time to explore themselves and the world they suddenly inhabited. They developed languages and customs, establishing traditions that would one day be the framework for their descendant’s societies.

As the original tribes grew in number, they inevitably splintered. Internal conflicts and strife drove many groups to seek homes away from their birthlands, setting out into the endless seas. From these splinter tribes came alternate traditions and dialects, spreading outward into the near seas as the original tribes matured. And, as Archians met Archians, it was clear to them that they were born of the same power. This didn’t necessarily instill comradery, and ultimately led to each tribe claiming its own name.

### Universal Potential

*He rounded the bend, muscles crackling with arcane energy and tendons straining far beyond their natural limits. There were three others a few yards ahead of him, blocking his way forward. Time slowed as his eyes dashed from side to side, and he saw it: a slight gap in the left flank. I small opening, sure, but it was all he had. There was no other way but forward.*

*His ears rang as he crossed the tape, unable to hear the cheering crowd over the pounding of his own heart.*

The final form of the Archian, as wrought by the third child, was apparently meeker than its other works. These creatures, however, traded outright prowess for a near-limitless potential. While most Archians would be relegated to simple, menial lives, the greatest among them would rival even the original inhabitants of the world.

#### Arcane Biology

The body of an Archian is laced with arcane potential. While the average person is largely unimpressive, those who have trained their body even moderately unlock a strength hidden within themselves. Muscles contract with unnatural efficiency and bones resist blows that could mangle solid steel. Trained soldiers can easily go toe-to-toe with large predators, and the strongest Archians can easily shrug off direct artillery hits.

#### Weaponized Minds

As exemplified by modern arcanists, an Archian’s mind is a powerful and dangerous tool when honed properly. The arcane-charged neurons of a well-trained brain are capable of much more than abstract thought, and allow an arcanist to enact their will directly onto the world around them. Master arcanists can generate and wield tremendous amounts of arcane energy, rivalling the destructive power of conventional ordnance.

  

### Distortion of the Foundational Aspects

Though the third child separated biological sex from the foundational aspects of masculinity and femininity, it did not shy from instilling them in all of its creations. This was inconsequential, as long as a balance was maintained, until the Archians. Simple beasts were not aware enough to care, and the simulacra had no biological sex to couple with their genders.

The Archians, with the awareness of the simulacra and the biological features of beasts, were perfectly equipped to twist the foundational aspects to their will. As cultures rose and fell, masculinity and femininity became tied to biological sex, and gender roles emerged across the barrier.

This distortion, however, is kept in balance by the fundamental rules put in place by the architect eons ago. The balance between masculine and feminine is preserved, as the world reacts to the free will of the Archians and adjusts itself accordingly.

### Cossim

Deep in the genetics of the lineages of the Barrier lies a secret hidden by the third child. Once in a great while, this seed would bloom in the form of a newborn Cossim. These strange Archians were entirely unlike their parents, and bore inky skin covered in shimmering patterns. Naturally aloof and undeniably different than their peers, these seemingly immortal people rarely remained in their original tribes, opting instead to wander. Before long, their legacy was established as strange, wandering Archians content with lonely immortality.

#### Born of Stars and Chance

Cossim are the smallest lineage, rarely standing more than 5 feet. Their thin frames, rarely over 100 pounds, are caught easily in the winds of wanderlust. The features of a Cossim are almost universally soft, their faces thin and rounded. Their eyes tend to be larger than those of other lineages, bearing sparkling irises. The most apparent of the Cossims’ features is their skin. They are draped in dark, iridescent flesh that bares wondrous patterns of light and color. These patterns are unique to each Cossim and may glow softly under specific conditions unique to each Cossim.

Cossim don’t age beyond adulthood and are biologically immortal. However, the wear and tear of life on the Barrier Sea take its toll regardless, and very few Cossim, live beyond a few centuries old before some streak of misfortune takes them. Cossim also have no genetic sex and are thus unable to reproduce. While the exact body shape of Cossim varies greatly, it is often difficult to discern what gender a Cossim may most neatly conform to due to their lack of cultural displays, that is if they conform to any gender at all.

#### A Vagrant People

Inherently, Cossim are a vagrant people and have no history or language to call their own. The spontaneous circumstance of their existence drives many Cossim to solitude, where they may be lucky to meet another of their own kind. Coupled with their inability to have any children of their own, it is almost entirely unheard of for a Cossim to settle in a single place for more than a few years.

Naturally, there are no traditional Cossim names. Cossim are sometimes named after the lineage of their parents, in the same way an ordinary child would be. More often, however, the parents of a Cossim will give the child a less standard name. These range from bastardizations of names from lineages exotic to the parents to abstract concepts. Some Cossim cast off their given names in adulthood, with some going as far as to live a different name in every new land they wander into.

  

### Girt

On a hot, salty rock dotted with habitable oases, the Girt were placed by the third child. This land would eventually be affectionately known as Brine, and the Girt its sole inheritors. Naturally orderly and thrifty, the Girt quickly began to thrive in their home, and were the first peoples to navigate the seas.

#### Practically Small

Girt are a thin and bony people, usually standing on the lower end of 5 feet and rarely weighing in at over 150 pounds. Preemptively adapted to hot, sunny places, they have dark skin and dark hair, the latter ranging from wavy to tightly curled. The bony features of Girt are easily recognizable, with their gaunt faces bearing sharp features and their sharp, dark eyes betraying an uncanny wit.

Girt live moderately long lives, with a life expectancy of about 80 years.

#### Contractually Inclined

Though smaller and weaker than the other lineages, the mental prowess of the Girt allowed them to quickly establish a codified society, far before some lineages even had an established language beyond grunts and gestures. By the end of the first millennia of their existence, they has begun building properly sea-worthy vessels. They had named their homeland, made official a capital city, and began devising protocols to chart the vast seas that lay ahead of them.

Girt culture is rooted in procedure and hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy, as the literal bearer of families, is the mother. Women, alongside men considered effeminate, act as officials and governors, directing society as the more masculine men (and occasionally women) built cities and sailed ships.

Beyond the base, matriarchal structure of society was a material hierarchy. In the salt-blasted lands on Brine, material goods were life. Those who had the resources had power, as one could not simply move elsewhere and have any hope of sustaining themselves. These ruling Girt dressed opulently as a sign of their status, with those that lived under them dressing more modestly as a sign of respect towards those that provided. Due to their overwhelming and effective procedures and protocols, Girt were brutally efficient in assimilating other tribes into their societies.

The Girt’s love for protocol was embedded in their language, built to be comprehensive and exact. It is a complex language formed of strict rules that allow speech to be precise and communicated ideas to be relatively immutable. In its written form, it lends itself to airtight agreements and contracts. Eventually, these efficacies would lead to the formation of the Brineflame Empire, the crowning Girt achievement on the modern barrier

Girt names tend to be short and utilize simple structures. Names are often handed down through families, along with a numerical identifier. Girt have surnames differ in that they are longer and more complex, such that there is little ambiguity in identities.

#### Prim and Proper

Culturally, the original Girt were a proper people, bordering on pretentious. So, when it came to meals, it was important that proper decorum be observed. This was not a problem for those with grand halls and troves of tableware, but was impractical for the average person.

The solution to this was the Vichi, a pocket of unleavened bread stuffed with preserved fruits and vegetables and dried meats. It was seen as a clean and proper way to eat a meal without dirtying one’s hands, and before long was spread across the barrier by maritime travelers.

  

### Derge

The original home of the stoic Derge was the northern mountain ranges of Uthren. In this freezing realm, the powerful bodies of the Derge were hardened, and their minds steeled. In spite of their short lifespans, they conquered their homeland and bent the cold stone to their will.

#### A Warrior’s Physique

Derge stand among the tallest and strongest of the barrier peoples. Few of these muscled folk stand under 6 feet tall, with some standing well over 7 feet. The largest Derge can easily reach over 300 pounds.

The natural bulk of the Derge makes them easily recognizable among diverse groups, as few folk can match their silhouette. Their facial features of broad and angular, and they often have a slight underbite that causes their jaw to be more pronounced. Both their skin and hair come in all manner of earthen hues. Most Derge also decorate their bodies with piercings and tattoos, usually with the purpose of outwardly declaring their life’s accomplishments.

Though they are strong and stalwart, Derge have a tragically short lifespan. Most live only to 40 years, as their body’s begin to age rapidly after roughly 30 years.

#### Honor and Family

After quickly learning to subsist in their harsh home, the Derge organized under powerful leaders. During their first millennium on the barrier, the Derge carved impressive fortresses from the rocky ridges. Each fortress acted as the home of a clan, with most clans cooperating to survive in the hard peaks, regularly clashing with the dangerous primordials native to the area.

Early Derge society was orderly and efficient. Every individual played their role, contributing to the prosperity of their clan. Hunting bands consisted almost entirely of Derge men, and often coming into bloody conflicts with local primordials. Derge women, along with some of the milder Derge men, built and tended to their fortress homes, and forged strong armaments from the iron-rich ore of the mountains. The two groups rarely interacted, with the hunting bands spending most of their lives away from their homes. Producing offspring was a purely utilitarian activity, with romantic partners almost exclusively existing within groups.

The Derge defied their short lifespans with the great feats they accomplished, both individually and as collectives. Before long, the north had been tamed by them, and they turned their gaze southward into the lush valley to the south. Here, they met the Marr nation of Carthia. Naturally, the Derge introduced themselves by an honorable show of strength, which the Carthians perceived as an attack on their people. After a few centuries, the conflict was abruptly ended via a Carthian superweapon that devastated the entirety of northern Uthren, leaving only smoldering scars and leagues of displaced Derge.

After the calamity that destroyed their home, most Derge clans left Uthren in search of new lands. Those that remained had to learn to live in a new world, where ice and fire conspired against them daily in a land that had become even more hostile.

The Derge language is harsh and guttural, with each clan developing slightly different dialects. Derge names follow the natural patterns of their language, being likewise harsh and short and devised to be spoken in shouts and cries. Derge also bear clan names, which are longer names used to invoke the spirit and specialties of the clan, such as Allseer, Earthbreaker, Stonefist, or Stormcaller.

  

### Hjark

Sturdy and industrious, the Hjark were built to convert raw, earthly resources into wondrous and awe-inspiring constructs. The first Hjark were appropriately nestled into the south-central mountains of Shalica, where there was an abundance of natural resources.

#### Stout and Hardy

Hjark are tall and strong, suited to long days of physical, often precise work. Most stand slightly above 6 feet tall, weighing around 200 pounds (give or take a few dozen pounds in either direction). Their skin ranges from fair to light brown. They have bright eyes reflecting their ingenuity, and strong, bony facial features. Their hair is often straight or wavy, coming in hues of red, brown, and blonde.

Hjark are one of the longest-lived peoples, with an average life expectancy of around 100 years. They tend to maintain their strength and wits well into adulthood, usually only starting to decline as they reach their 80s.

#### Building Tall and Wide

Safely cradled in the mountains of southern Shalica, the early Hjark had plenty of time to grow and create during the early history of the barrier. Content with staying in one place, only a few Hjark had left Shalica by the end of the first millennium. In this time, the entirety of southern Shalica had been settled by the Hjark, stemming from their original mountain city. They left the northern regions of Shalica well enough alone, not wanting to disturb the northwestern Vyld (of whom they had a comfortable peace with), and finding no value in the endless deserts of northeastern Shalica.

As the Hjark begun exploring the seas around their home, the Selk of Sunspire arrived on Shalica. Being pleasant and amicable, the Hjark welcomed these new people and allowed them to do as they pleased across Shalica. These Selk quickly learned of the genesis forge buried under Shalica, of which Hjark historians had been carefully cataloging and studying. Selk arc-engineers had different plans, and their exploitation of the ancient technology eventually lead to the ruin the great Selk city of Avana and the exodus of the Selk from Shalica. Forgiving the Selk almost immediately, Hjark led expansive rescue operations into ruined, Selk cities infested with malfunctioning automata. Many of the recovered Selk opted to stay on Shalica rather than return to Sunspire, living alongside the Hjark.

By the time the Girt of Brine had arrived on Shalica and allied with the Hjark, the latter had industrialized their society and recently begun utilizing the power of steam and electricity to further mechanize. The works wrought by Hjark engineers rivalled the arcane technologies of the Selk of Sunspire, now guided more carefully under their celestial orders. While the Hjark were unconcerned with the technological competition, the Girt saw this as an opportunity to rival the Selk, who were unreceptive to Girt alliances. Thus, the matrimony of Girt ambitions and Hjark ingenuity birthed the alliance that would one day become the Brineflame Empire.

  

#### Robust Complexity

The complexity of the Hjark’s machinations are reflected in their culture. Every individual in Hjark society acts as a component to a complicated machine. When the components of this societal machine work together in harmony, and they often do, Hjark are capable of accomplishing great feats of industry.

The roles of each individual are broadly categorized into Hjon (the masculine roles, plural Hjonni) and Hjin (the feminine roles, plural Hjinni) These roles are only loosely based on biological sec, with a decent minority of Hjark falling into a role opposite of their biological sex. The Hjon roles are filled by colder, more calculated individuals that often spend long periods away from their homes. Hjon often work as surveyors, explorers, or traders. Hjin roles, occupied by warmer, more hospitable folk, include engineers, architects, and service workers. Relationships tend to be between a Hjon and a Hjin, with a notable rate of non-reproducing relationships.

The Hjark language, like Hjark society, is fairly complex, utilizing base words modified with various syllables to convey specific meaning and context. The script uses extendable runes to efficiently convey complex ideas. Hjark names, in contrast, are often warm and simple, with their purpose to be inviting and easy to remember. Rather than surnames, Hjark will often use the name of their hometown (or neighborhood in larger cities).

#### Everyone’s Got a Kyorshchyorv

One of the greatest (and only) cultural exports of the original Hjark society is kyorshchyorv, a simple cuisine with variations found across the modern barrier. At its simplest, kyorshchyorv is a wedged tuber topped with various dressings. It was practical, hearty, and comforting, reflecting those who created it.

However, as the cuisine spread and specialized, local peoples began devising more extravagant and unique forms of kyorshchyorv. It’s common to see street vendors peddling tremendous, unwieldly mounds of kyorshchyorv to tourists on busy city streets across the barrier.

  

### Ingra

At the southeastern coast of Uthren lies a sprawling, sun-blasted desert. Among the shaded canyon-oases that wind through this wasteland, the first Ingra carved their opulent homes into the sandstone cliff faces. The Ingra were more concerned with earthly beauty and self-perfection over trade and industry, developing decorated communes rather than functional cities.

#### Flesh of Amber

Ingra are tall and slender, with sharp, shapely features. They stood 6 to 7 feet tall, usually weighing slightly over 200 pounds. Their skin is a glistening umber color, and their eyes sparkles in hues of violet and green. While their hair is naturally found in hues of brown or red, it’s often dyed.

Ingra are inherently athletic and dexterous, suited equally to combat and fine arts. Their life expectancy is slightly shorter than most other peoples, with most Ingra only living to their early 60s. They remain at peak physical condition for a very long time, with most only showing their age during their last few years alive. Because of this, it’s often difficult to discern the age of an adult Ingra until they are very near their death.

#### Timeless Communes

A naturally wayward people, the first Ingra left the original commune within the first decades of their existence on Uthren. Most travelled to other regions of the desert, searching for particularly aesthetic region to carve new homes into. Some left the desert and found themselves in the fields of central Uthren, long before the nation of Carthia was founded in those lands. Others left Uthren to brave the seas in search for new lands to inspire them, and most found such places. As other lineages began spreading throughout the barrier during and shortly after the first millennium, they often found Ingra communes nestled into pleasant niches, living in harmony with the natural world around them. Those that attempted to conquer these communes found that the arcane warriors among the Ingra more than capable of defending their homes and peoples, having devoted their entire existence to their craft.

The Ingra were entirely unconcerned with constructing sprawling cities or developing intricate societies. They would rather feed their egos by perfecting their minds and bodies, always practicing their preferred crafts with little desire for any sort of payment beyond the continued support of their commune. Relationships tended to be brief and passionate, with the lack concern for the participants biological sex reflecting the Ingra’s general lack of gender constructs. Children were born to transient couples and raised by the community, with few Ingra holding commitments beyond themselves and their arts.

Due to their passive nature in regard to diplomacy, they often found themselves to be a part of developing nations. In exchange for readily given artisan goods and mercenary work, local governing bodies left the communes to their own devices. It’s common for modern Ingra to live alongside other peoples in towns and cities, and they often find it easy to make coin due to their extreme devotion to their crafts.

The Ingra language incorporates many flourishes and body language that can be difficult to interpret by non-native speakers. Traditionally, the written language includes an almost excessive amount of improvised decoration, with each character a piece of art in and of itself. This does, however, make traditional Ingra literature difficult to read even for native speakers.

As children, Ingra are almost always referred to by various nicknames. When they come of age, Ingra choose their own name. These chosen names vary wildly in style in structure, acting as a reflection of the person it labels. Among lifelong friends, Ingra may continue the user of their childhood nicknames, though in improper contexts the usage of such names may be insulting.

  

### Marr

There are no lineages quite as forgettable or as plenty as the Marr. These folk are impressively average, living simple, comfortable lives. Though they are originally form the fertile fields of central Uthren, groups of settlers splintered from the original tribe throughout history, spreading far across the seas of the barrier.

#### Nothing of Note

Marr usually range from 5 to 6 feet tall, and normally weigh anywhere from 100 to 200 pounds. It’s rare for pureblooded Marr to deviate from these averages much, though their adaptability may shift their stature in more extreme environments. This adaptability causes the other properties of the Marr, such as their skin and hair, to vary wildly form place to place. Regardless of where one may find Marr, they will always seem as if they’re meant to be there.

Marr often live a to a comfortably average 70 years of age, their vigor slowly waning after their 30s. They tend to have many children, mostly owing to their short gestation periods. A single Marr woman can bear 3 children in a single year.

One of the only notable traits of the Marr is their uncanny ability to adapt to their social and physical environment. In a single cosmic cycle, a Marr individual can fully assimilate into a culture, and within 10 cycles, their physical appearance and even their build can change to better suit whatever environment they find themselves in, with only the colors of an individual’s eyes remaining truly constant. These adaptations are passed on to their offspring,

#### The Pursuit of Comfort

One of the only ambitions of Marr is to make their lives easier and more comfortable. To this end, the original tribe devised simple and effective laws and established the town of Carthia, where the lot of them lived easy lives. This town grew to a city, then a network of cities, and finally a grand nation. At no point was this the end goal of the Marr, but rather a natural progression as they sought systems that would ease the load of their daily lives.

In the nation of Carthia, no individual Marr bore more than a few simple responsibilities. Even the leadership, a council formed of frequently rotating members, was designed to be light work.

As the nation grew and the other lineages began spreading across the barrier, other peoples assimilated into the now-grand nation of Carthia. The Marr of Carthia were happy to let these new, more ambitious people take the reins. However, after the calamity wrought by a non-Marr council on the Derge of north Uthren, the Marr reluctantly took control of their nation back, ensuring that the ambitions of other peoples would no longer disrupt the comfortable lives of Carthians.

When left to their own devices, the culture of Marr is plain and undecorated. They value tradition and consistency, with their life goal usually being little more than rearing a happy family. However, when among other peoples, Marr will mold themselves into the dominant culture. A Marr living in the industrial Brineflame Empire would behave much differently than one found farming in the fields of Carthia.

The Marr tongue is plain, relying heavily on body language and inflection. Non-speakers that overhear a Marr conversation will often mistake it for idle grumblings. The written word of the Marr is also difficult to parse, relying heavily on the reader knowing the specific context of the writing and knowing the writer personally.

Marr names are as plain as their language. They rarely consist of more than a few syllables, and are easy to pronounce and remember. Marr surnames are fairly fluid, and don’t always denote family ties. These surnames are usually associated with a profession, or other notable constant in a Marr or an immediate family of Marr.

  

### Selk

The Selk were placed alone on the lush, mountainous continent that they would eventually come to call Sunspire. This temperate land basked in the golden rays of the cosmic engine, and was exceedingly hospitable to the fragile Selk. It was here that the great minds of these people were put to work, and their natural talent for the arcane was refined.

#### Trading Bodies for Minds

Selk are a soft and slight people, often standing between 5 and 6 feet tall but rarely weighing more than 150 pounds. Their smooth skin glistens subtly in hues of copper, silver, and gold. Their rounded faces, in combination with their stature, give them an entirely unintimidating look. Their piercing, deeply colorful eyes, dance with innate arcane energies.

One of the longer-lived lineages, Selk often live to 90 years of age. They spend most of the time they’re given on intellectual pursuits, ranging from the purely scientific astronomy to the practical applications of arcane engineering.

While all people have some innate control over the arcane energies that permeate the world, the Selk have it in relative abundance. Even untrained Selk can commonly achieve simple arcane tasks, and most arcane master on the barrier are unsurprisingly of Selk blood.

#### Forged in Catastrophe

As the original Selk settlement grew into a nation spanning the entire (albeit small) continent now known by the Selk as Sunspire, various bands of settlers left their motherland in search of new homes across the barrier. One of the first lands these travelling Selk landed on was Shalica, inhabited by the original Vyld and Hjark tribes. The Selk were welcomed by the hospitable Hjark, and began constructing new cities in this grander, more resource-rich land. The Selk of Shalica rarely interacted with the Vyld, finding the jungle homeland of the bestial peoples far too hostile.

After many centuries on Shalica, the Selk unearthed evidence of the Shalica genesis forge with the help of their Hjark friends. This discovery led to a technological explosion that led to the Selk’s utter mastery over all of Shalica. However, in their hubris, the Selk delved too deeply into ancient secrets. In their capital city of Avana, situated on the mountainous northern shore of Shalica, they unlocked powers that they could not control, and plunged the entirety of their capital deep into the barrier. The effects of this arcane singularity rippled across Shalica, wreaking havoc on the northern half continent and generally destabilizing the southern half.

With this catastrophic failure, most Selk that still considered themselves part of the original Selk collective retreated back to Sunspire. There, Selk leaders established a new order that gave birth to the modern civilization of Sunspire. This new governance oversaw all aspects of Sunspire society to ensure that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated.

  

#### Roles and Hierarchies

Selk society is based primarily on three roles, similar to more traditional gender roles found in other cultures. Moon Selk acted as gentle caretakers, sun Selk were stalwart defenders of Sunspire, and Selk of the eldest star were seen as outcasts and practiced fringe sciences only barely tolerated by the other roles. Within each role, individuals progress solely based on their capabilities. Since familial ties are all but disregarded when Selk reach adulthood, each individual must stand on their own merit.

The Selk tongue is prohibitively difficult to learn, being made of tens of thousands of complex symbols, all with a very specific meanings.

Selk are given a simple name at birth, and are given a more complex adult name by their peers when they are deemed an adult, which is based on their first notable accomplishment. A Selk’s name can change as they age, reflecting greater and greater accomplishments and becoming increasingly complex. One of the premier desires of a Selk is to end their lives with a grandiose name

  

### Vyld

In the dense jungles of northwest Shalica, the first Vyld fought for dominance among fierce beasts and ancient primordials. And, against all odds, they won it. Since their dawn, the highest concentration of Vyld has been the expansive kingdom of Glissik, a network of treetop cities covering a large swathe of jungle. Ruled by a line of monarchs selected by the masses for their legendary prowess, these remote people have enjoyed relatively unchanged prosperity.

#### The Physiology of the Vyld

Vyld are an incredibly diverse lot with incredibly unstable genetics. This leaves few useful averages for vyld stature, save for notably broad, flat faces that make them easy to spot in a crowd. Their more exotic include, majestic manes of hair, horns, and exterior bone plating.

All pure-blooded Vyld are biological hermaphrodites, with both male and female reproductive organs. This, along with their high genetic mutation rate, makes it easier for a small number of Vyld to populate an area while maintaining genetic diversity. This has been important throughout Vyld history, as few live beyond 50, have they a penchant for making their homes in harsh places.

#### The History and Culture of the Vyld

Though it took some time for the original Vyld to establish dominance in their home and establish the kingdom of Glissik, they were almost entirely undisturbed until making contact with the Hjark that shared Shalica. The two peoples enjoyed peace, despite their differences. Neither side was interested in fighting one another, having their own respective endeavors to pursue.

The limited diplomatic exchanges between Hjark and Vyld were mutually beneficial. Hjark architects made possible the intricate treetop kingdom of Glissik, and Vyld martial masters were more than happy to hunt dangerous primordials in the remote valleys of Southern Shalica. However, after the catastrophe brought down on the continent by the Selk of Avana, the Vyld closed their borders to outsiders. To this day, the Vyld of Glissik remain cut off from the rest of the barrier.

Though the kingdom of Glissik isolated itself, Vyld continued to spread across the barrier. They did this almost exclusively in tightly bonded groups of mating pairs. Vyld normally mate for life and keep a close social circle of likeminded pairs that form the fundamental relationships of Vyld culture. These Vyld bands spread far into the seas, sometimes integrating with existing peoples in new lands and sometimes establishing new Vyld kingdoms. Those that assimilate with other lineages find that their bloodlines dilute quickly, easily overtaken by the more stable genetics of other lineages. What remains, however, is their innate strength and dexterity. People that bear Vyld blood are prized among standing armies for their uncanny martial capabilities, and their inherent predator spirit.

The Vyld tongue is simple, with the naturally empathetic Vyld traditionally communicating through emotion and action. Their written language consists of pictographs, which are often easy to read even for non-speakers due to their intuitiveness and straightforward meanings.

Traditionally, Vyld are given a simple birth name that serves as a plain description, often invoking the most obvious physical features of the individual. As a Vyld grows into adulthood, their names are modified based on their personalities or accomplishments. Aged, accomplished Vyld can have excessively long names that act as their legacy.

Among friends, Vyld tend to use simpler forms of their names. However, in more formal settings, it is considered respectful to refer to Vyld as their full, earned names.

  

### The Cardinal Lands of the Central Seas

Directly to the north, south, east, and west of the anchor lie four continents, the largest of the many lands of the central seas. These continents sit almost exactly 500 miles from the anchor in their respective directions and were the homes of the original Archian lineages.

#### Shalica

To the north of the Anchor lies the continent of Shalica. A sizeable landmass, this island was the original home of both the Vyld and Hjark. This land rivals the larger continent of Uthren in biome diversity and is by far the most resource-rich of the cardinal lands.

Northern Shalica houses an expansive Vyld-inhabited jungle to the west and a vast desert to the east, separated by near-uncrossable mountain range. Southern Shalica houses less harsh terrain, with a meadowed eastern region and a lush valley to the west. In the center, nestled in the central mountain range that splits the continent vertically, is the ore-rich home of the Hjark.

#### Uthren

Opposite Shalica, to the south of the anchor, is the largest of the cardinal continents, and one of the largest continents on the barrier. This land, Uthren, is home to three of the original lineages.

To the north, the Derge built mighty stone fortresses among snow-capped peaks (though this land would later be scarred by an ancient weapon unearthed by the nation of Carthia). Central Uthren is covered in meadows and forests and is one of the mildest regions of the barrier. Here, the Marr founded the nation of Carthia. At the southeastern coast of Uthren, the first Ingra made their home by carving intricate cities into canyon walls, thriving in the oasis valleys under the scorching sun.

#### Brine

The salty island of Brine, east of the Anchor, is the smallest of the cardinal lands. This arid land was rich in rare minerals and essential to the early success of the native Girt.

#### Sunspire

Only slightly larger than Brine, Sunspire is located west of the anchor. A temperate, mountainous land, this island acted as a cradle for the first Selk.

#### Enna, The Land Swept Aside

During the age of the third child, there existed a land wrapped around the base of the Anchor. This primordial continent by the name of Enna served the third child on behalf of Ithia and was the site of the central genesis forges. The forges, the grandest of their kind, were ultimately used to create the final Archians.

Understanding the mind-shattering knowledge contained within this land, the third child sundered the land and cast it to the far seas before the projects ended, where fragments of the once-proud primordial now float aimless and abandoned.

  

## 2.3  The Era of Civilization

*A woman meandered through thin alleys shimmering in blues and purples. She’d just finished a late shift, an held her coat tightly to herself as she scurried home through empty streets. This part of town was relatively quiet this deep into the night, cut subtly by the muted sounds of song and drink from a dingy pub. She chanced a quick stop inside to warm up, promising herself that she wouldn’t spend too much.*

The modern barrier, as it exists roughly 8,000 years after the dawn of the Archians, is vastly different from its ancient state. Whole continents have rearranged, and all manner of newly wrought life makes its home on the lands that dot the oceans. Dwarfing all of these monumental changes, however, is the crowned accomplishment of the third child: the Archians. As a collective, Archians have completely altered the seas in only a few thousand years, with their progress only accelerating over time.

This grand, cosmic perspective is, however, lost on most of the inhabitants of the barrier. Valiants risk life and limb for fortune without ever stopping to ponder how bare the world would be without them. Soldiers are sent to die far from home as nations squabble over sparse resources. Common folk often work mundane jobs and enjoy the comforts of the modern world, thinking little of their place in the cosmological structure and the endless conflict between order and chaos.

### A Distinct Lack of Resources

As populations across the central seas exploded, it became clear that the resources of the sparse island continents dotting the barrier would be stretched thin. Through efforts led chiefly by the Brineflame Empire, borders were drawn and treatises written to dictate the collection and utilization of natural resources. These international laws, of course, would be constantly leveraged for political and material power by governments across the seas.

#### Abstraction through Coinage

While the concept of currency has existed on the barrier for nearly as long as Archians have, it’s execution was arguably perfected by the Brineflame Empire. The empire spared no resources in minting and spreading its coinage across the barrier, establishing commercial control both within and outside of its borders. The Brineflame Tin is backed by nothing other than an imperial promise, though this doesn’t seem to bother most people.

Modern Tins are mostly represented by paper bills printed by imperial mints. These bills range from being equivalent to a single Tin to representing one thousand Tins.

There are other systems of currency throughout the seas, but nearly everyone has a direct conversion to imperial Tins. One would be hard-pressed to find a vendor in even the furthest corners of the seas that would decline a handful of dirty Tins.

#### The Impact of Scarcity

Predictably, the general scarcity of resources affected the lowest rungs of society more than any other. Common Archians traded their time for coin in the form of labor. This transaction has been tightly tuned by governments and corporations, covering the basic necessities to workers while extracting as much value as possible from each individual. While this system has many critics across the barrier, proponents argue that any less efficient system would not support modern society’s needs. This explanation, however, fails to account for the luxury lived in by the wealthy elite.

  

### The Life of the Modern Archian

On the barrier face exposed to the deep, there are few constants. The physical properties of one’s world can change subtly on a daily basis. On the other face, however, prevailing order makes long-term development much more feasible. There are several boons conferred onto this barrier face by both the natural order of the cosmos above, and the controlled trickle of chaos form the deep below.

For people on the cosmos-facing barrier face, the consequences of their world cosmology is second nature. Astronomers use the skies to keep time and chart voyages, and simple folk blame passing inconveniences on the deep. While few, if any, understand the true nature of their world, its patterns have been leveraged by the peoples of the barrier since their dawn.

#### The Consequences of Communication

Cables and signals are commonplace even in the remote reaches of the modern world. Every dwelling is equipped with simple telecommunication devices, and more complex arrays throw signals across continents. New from Sunspire quickly makes its way to imperial news broadcasts, and Carthian advancements in technology can be shared with colleagues across the ocean in only a few instants.

These capabilities, however, are not without their consequences. Archians that don’t become wholly consumed by the constant stimulation of the entire world bearing down on them are quick to become disillusioned with their place in the world. It’s difficult to find any corner of the world that isn’t plagued with some sort of unrest or discontent, creating an arms race between more readily available information and more involved distractions.

#### Modern Locomotion

*I stood on the platform, staring into the threshold before me. Getting this far was no easy task, and I wondered about some alternative me that stayed here. Are they better or worse off for it? They’re probably skipping lunch again right now. I hope they’ll be alright.*

*“Train’s gotta leave in two minutes kid, you stayin’ or leavin’?”*

In developed regions of the barrier, getting from one place to another tends to be simple and quick. High-speed trains send goods and people across continents in mere hours, with the most advanced arcane engines capable of travelling and hundreds of miles per hour. In cities and towns, slower tram systems move people about both over and underground, freeing city streets up for pedestrians and personal motor vehicles.

On the seas, massive ships make intercontinental logistics possible. Crews and goods are constantly sent across the central and near seas, often utilizing trade protected routes to avoid becoming a meal for a wandering leviathan.

Above the barrier, in the skies reaching towards the cosmos, aeroplanes survey the lands and oceans below. While there are few passenger plane services, private pilots will often offer trips across the sea at steep prices. Sharing the airspace with these private pilots are military craft, including experimental projects such as Sunspire’s faster-than-sound arcjets.

  

### Keeping Time on the Barrier

The nature of the cosmos lends itself nicely to timekeeping. Even the simplest folk on the barrier know the chief stars of the night sky, while astronomers work tirelessly to map every inch of the clockwork skies. It is no surprise then, that Archians have been developing and refining timekeeping systems since their dawn.

#### Cosmic Cycles

The short-lived peoples of the barrier tend to treat the cosmic cycle as the largest unit of time, counting their lives in years. These years are further broken down into seasons, with each season lasting 91 days. During each day, the cosmic engine alternates between burning and cooling periods. The start of a new day is marked as the engines coolest, darkest point. Modern calendars also include 7-day weeks, following the rotation of Astida. This breaks each season down into 13 weeks, with each day of the week being named after a prominent celestial body. In the widely adopted Imperial Calendar, these days are, in order: Nada, Felda, Caeda, Lyrda, Astida, Zenda, and Kada

Each year begins with the season of spring. The first day of spring is when the cosmic engine hits its lowest point of activity, and slowly becomes more active through summer, the second season. Then, on the first day of autumn, the engine reaches its highest point of activity and becomes less and less active until the end of winter.

During periods of higher activity, the engine burns hotter and longer during the day, and its darker cooling periods are shorter. At its highest activity, when summer gives way to autumn, the engine burns for three quarters of the day. During times of lower activity, the engine burns gently and spends more time in its cooling period. During the day of its lowest activity, it spends three quarters of the day cooling.

Though the regular periods of the cosmos and the central engine are exact and unchanging through the eons, the chaotic forces of the deep give way to varied climates and ecosystems across the barrier. The chaotic influence of the deep keeps the barrier from being a uniform spattering of continents, but the order imposed by the cosmos keeps the individuals climes of barrier relatively unchanged as time passes.

#### Modern Calendars

The most commonly used calendar across the barrier is the Imperial Calendar, which was implemented by the Brineflame Empire when they transitioned from the Brineflame Pact. This particular calendar codified the names of days and seasons used across the empire and worked to establish order through a common system of time.

The Imperial Calendar standardized the breakdown of cosmic cycles into seasons, weeks, and days. Other calendars exist across the barrier, but none are as widely adopted as the Imperial Calendar.

  

#### Bearings in Time and Space

There are a collection of stars, some even visible during the day, that orbit the cosmic engine with intervals dictating every moment of the cosmic cycle. Using extremely precise instruments, it is possible to use the current position of these stars to locate oneself exactly in time and space. A learned astronomer or experienced traveler with the right tools and a clear view of the night sky can determine the current time along with their position on the barrier with startling precision.

Simpler instruments exist to quickly give the time along with one’s rough bearing on the barrier. Simple magnetic compasses that point towards the Anchor are often used by those travelling across the oceans to plot courses, and more complicated compasses that utilize the stars’ arcane fields can be used to determine cardinal directions. The accuracy of these compasses lessens as one travels away from the center of the world, making travel in the far seas difficult. In the unlit seas, all but the most sensitive instruments cease to work at all.

### Mobility via Valiancy

*"I'm tired, Pike…"*

*A large, sweaty man looked up from a smoking engine block. The scars crisscrossing his sun-kissed skin caught the day's last rays of light. He sighed at the woman. Her tangled hair and blood-stained suit blew lazily in the soft breeze.*

*"You can be tired later, right now we have to move. Truck's not startin' and we have another ten miles to go before dark'."*

*The man began moving to the back of the truck, towards the woman. He stopped at the passenger door, stealing one last glimpse of an old friend, now riddled with holes. He continued to the truck bed, collected their belongings, and turned westward toward the endless coastal highway.*

*"Fig's dead, and we'll be too if we stay here. I know I always say this, but this is our last job. Honest this time, please just walk with me."*

*The woman lowered her shoulders with a shaky breath. She looked backwards towards the truck, as if she was expecting something, or someone, to be there. She turned back towards the man.*

*"I'm so fucking tired, Pike."*

While valiants and their work exist mostly outside of the public eye, they are considered a necessary profession in modern times. To most people, they are considered akin cargo ship crew or civil engineers: many people have never met one and could scarcely say what they do, but society could not properly exist without them

  

#### The Birth of Valiancy

One of the oldest professions on the barrier is valiancy. Companies or individuals would travel about the seas, in search of difficult, risky, or simply undesirable work. For most of history, this career didn’t have a real name, and was considered lowly and opportunistic.

At some point, thousands of years before the birth of the Brineflame Empire, enough of these vagrant adventurer-mercenaries got together to form a loose system of rules and guidelines. They began referring to themselves as valiants, establishing standards and self-regulations. Over time, their efforts bore fruit, these valiants gained a slightly better reputation among the common Archians.

As modern societies congealed, valiants evolved to meet modern needs. They became more organized, employing contracts to dictate their work. Central guild halls began working with local governments in back-room deals, ensuring legal immunities for valiants and their clients. All of these efforts culminated in the modern Valiance Halls, a network of regional organizations that span even into the far seas. Under these halls, valiants take on all manner of contracts, risking their lives for a bit of cash.

#### The Modern Valiant

*A close call and fading adrenaline brought their battered bodies home*

*A brief exchange of blood and spit lulled their broken minds to sleep*

When most common folk think of valiants, they will inevitably conjure an image of the rare veteran: a powerful and worldly individual that commands fear and respect. In reality, however, most valiants, are barely more than regular people trying to claw their way out of the rat-race that is their daily lives. Many valiants take on one, maybe two contracts a year in an attempt to supplement their income or cover expenses. Very few will take on more than a few jobs in their lives. Many die, most are scarred physically and mentally, and some got what they wanted out of it and simply have no need to go back to valiancy. Ultimately, very few valiants become career valiants, and even less veteran valiants.

  

### The Arcane

Arcane forces and energy permeate the world as echoes of the unimaginable power of the architect. This strange phenomenon is studied intensely by nearly every modern civilization and is responsible for many of the modern wonders of the world.

#### Arcane Energy

Just as pressure drives hydraulics and electromagnetic fields carry power over cables, arcane energy is a fundamental force of the universe that can be understood and utilized. Nearly every living creature in the world can manipulate or sense it to some extent, and many natural materials interact with arcane forces in various, novel ways.

Individual Archians can hone their own arcane capabilities to better sense and manipulate these forces, and machines can be built to leverage arcane power to achieve incredible feats.

As with traditional energies, arcane energy creates many natural phenomena in the world. Arcane energy naturally coalesces, which can create high-power areas. These zones, while they last, can sustain and empower. In some cases, arcanists living in high-energy zones can subsist of nothing at all for entire seasons. Arcane winds blow across the seas, their points of confluence potentially culminating in devastating arcane storms. These storms are brief, awesome releases of arcane power that can level cities in minutes. Fortunately, like their mundane counterparts, these storms often happen far from any shores, with only the architect witnessing their elegant brutality.

#### Creation, Destruction, and the Changing of Forms

Unlike mundane forms of energy, arcane energy regularly flows in to and out of the world. Sources such as the cosmic engine, the deepheart, primordial hearts, and (to an extremely lesser extent) the biological processes of simple beings such as Archians constantly bring arcane energy into the world. Meanwhile, arcane energy is constantly decaying. Arcane fields weaken over time, and any arcane acts sink a portion of their arcane energy as a cost for creating whatever force may come of them. This leads to constantly shifting balance, as arcane potentials are constantly created and destroyed.

Many applications of arcane energy see it changing forms. It can be transformed into conventional energies, such as kinetic or electrical energies, or even converted directly into physical matter. Effectively, all energy and matter in the world is a form of arcane energy.

All transformations of arcane energy see a large minority of the arcane energy used or created destroyed, imposing an extremely inefficient cost on working with arcane energy.

The world attempts to exert balancing forces on the net amount of arcane energy contained within it. Should something cause an excess of energy in the world, sources of arcane energy will slow their generation, and the natural decay of arcane fields will hasten. If the world would find itself in an arcane energy deficit, sources of energy would increase their production, and the ambient decay of energy would slow.

#### Practical Applications

The abundance of arcane energy in the world means that, even with its innate inefficiencies, it finds many practical uses across the barrier. Arcane lights can be powered indefinitely by tiny fragments of primordial hearts, and smaller gadgets and gizmos can operate in the same way without requiring external power sources. Heavy cargo containers are manipulated at ports by massive arcane pylons that exert simple (albeit large) kinetic forces to move good about. More often than not, however, arcane power is harvested and converted to electrical energy, for use in more efficient mundane technologies.

  

#### The Arcane Art of Teleportation

One of the most exotic application of arcane energy is the act of nearly-instantly translocating matter from one location to another. Proper execution of arcane teleportation can move matter across the barrier at light-speeds (the same speed at which arcane energy is maximally able to propagate) without the requirement infrastructure anywhere but the source of the teleportation.

The hurdles to doing this are myriad, with the first being the energy cost itself. Converting between arcane energy and matter is extremely costly, with the transmutation of only a few kilograms of matter costing the same amount of power as an entire household over the course of weeks. Converting the arcane energy back into matter at the destination requires an equivalent amount of power. Moving the resultant energy requires even more power, as does correctly encoding the instructions on how far to move before converting back into matter. The amount of energy it would take to teleport a person a few miles in this way is equivalent to the energy it takes to power Alburn, one of the largest imperial cities, for a day.

Even with the power requirements met, there is still the issue of energy decay. Every instant the packet of arcane energy is in transit, it is subject to the natural decay of ambient arcane energy. Over distance more than a mile, this can result in information loss. For a translocated test material, this can lead to defects observable under a microscope. For a person, the effects could be more disastrous.

Some more practically usable technologies have been born of research into teleportation. Chiefly among these is material generation, in which small amounts of rare or valuable material can be generated using immense amounts of power. This is usually more expensive than acquiring the material ordinarily but has its use cases.

A form of short-range teleportation, commonly referred to as slip-teleportation, is used more commonly to quickly move things across shorter distances. Slip-teleportation encodes physical matter into ambient arcane energy, and instantly decodes it in a nearby space. This quick encoding and decoding very reliably leaves the subject matter intact and uses very little energy. And, while a technically complex feat, programmed arcane mechanisms can allow even (wealthier) laypeople access to this technology.

#### Primordial Hearts in Modern Technology

Primordial hearts serve as endless wells of tappable energy. Engineers must take care, however, as the heart does not cease its natural function even when being exploited in this way. There are documented cases of primordials taking over systems powered by their hearts, though modern containment procedures minimize the risk of this. The usage of large primordial hearts is often avoided, as past incidents, such as Avana’s tapping into a massive primordial heart in the genesis forge below its streets, have wrought destruction un unprecedented scales.

Unfortunately for the entrepreneurial hunters of the barrier, most primordials found near civilizations are little more than embryos in an aging process that takes place on the scale of millennia. Their hearts would keep a few lights on, at best.

  

# 3    The Brineflame Empire
![[Pasted image 20241024222849.png]]

Originally an alliance between the Girt of Saphis and the Hjark of Southstar, the Brineflame Empire is the marriage of two masteries. The seafaring Girt’s commercial dominion over the vast oceans, when combined with the industrious Hjark’s mastery over land and forge, created a veritable force that has since expanded across the barrier magnitudes further than any other nation.

Now including peoples from across the central and near seas, the Brineflame Empire contains spans dozens of continents, and holds innumerable smaller islands. The hands of the empire work tirelessly within and outside of its borders, ensuring that coin flows and power remains concentrated in the councils of its sister capitals.

## 3.1  Building an Empire

Though the empire proper has only existed for about 1,000 years, the story of its formation spans back several thousand years more. From a convenient alliance between Girt and Hjark established barely a thousand years after the Archian Dawn, the modern Brineflame empire has grown to become the most powerful and expansive nation in the world.

### The Brineflame Pact

Before the Brineflame Empire was the Brineflame Pact, an alliance formed between the original tribes of Girt of Saphis and the Hjark of Southstar.

#### Forming the Pact

The city of Saphis, crowned as the jewel of Brine only a few hundred years after the Archian Dawn, supported the first proper naval fleets of the world. As these fleets surveyed their surroundings and made contact with other Archians across the central seas, the Hjark of Southstar dug deep mines and constructed grand forges. The ambitions of these two peoples couple perfectly, and an immediate alliance was formed between them.

#### New Neighbors

Then, more than 2,000 years after the Dawn, the Selk-established the colony of Avana in northern Shalica. At this time, the Brineflame Pact had grown to a powerful military alliance. As Avana grew and expanded due to technologies unearthed from Shalica’s genesis forge, relations between Brineflame and Avana strained. These tenuous relations were at their most stressed 1,000 years later, when Avana sat as the capital of a Selk-led nation that spanned Shalica and overshadowed the Pact in every metric.

In response to outbreaks of skirmishes and subterfuge, Avana brought the full weight of its nation upon the Pact. Forces mechanized by advanced arcane tech crushed the Pact’s military forces across the central seas, and the alliance had effectively collapsed under this unbearable weight. However, after nearly 500 years of barely sustained Brineflame resistance Avana was no more. In a single, gross act of hubris, the ambitious Selk had pushed their stolen technology beyond its limits and sunk their capital into the sea.

  

#### The Dark Ages of Brineflame

The catastrophe of Avana was not considered a victory for the Brineflame Pact. The alliance had been almost nonexistent for hundreds of years at this point. The Girt of Saphis were unable to leave Brine thanks to a total naval blockade, and the city of Southstar had become a militarized fortress city, producing goods for Avana in exchange for their safety. With the destruction wrought throughout all of Shalica, there was little room for diplomacy as survivors clung to a broken land.

It was only hundreds of years after the catastrophe of Avana that the Pact was properly reformed, nearly 4,000 years after the Archian Dawn now. With the exodus of the Selk from Shalica, the Girt from Saphis eventually gathered themselves and were able to aid the Southstar Hjark in restoring stability to Shalica. This process was slow, with the young ambitions of both peoples being replaced with sensible caution.

This period of fear and reconstruction lasted for roughly 3,000 years, during which the alliance regularly fell in and out of practice. Then, over 7,000 years after the Archian Dawn, international relations had stabilized, and old scars had healed. The Girt of Saphis and the Hjark of Southstar were once again ready leverage their combined strength.

### The Birth of an Empire

By the eight millennium, the Archians of the barrier had seen the rise and fall of many nations. The central seas had seen two Archian-made extinction events, and the aspirations of the first tribes had dimmed. Sunspire and Carthia had long ago isolated themselves, fearing their own capabilities and those of their neighbors. Smaller nations in the near seas engaged in little more than trade, and the international stage was mostly quiet.

#### Primed for New Power

The world was waiting for something to once again reach out towards greatness. Hearing this subtle call, the council that passively headed the Brineflame Pact acted, enshrining their alliance permanently and becoming a single power. In a single season, the brightest and boldest minds of the two members drafted a treatise and gathered their allies. And, in that one season, the first council of the Brineflame Empire was formed over the corpses of any opposition.

Forged in brutal efficiency, this new empire had a single goal: to unite all of the Barrier under a single superpower, no matter the cost. The ambitions lost to the ages, it seemed, had been found anew. Lands were conquered, and progress was made on every civil and military front. Cities of millions, the likes of which had not been seen since the days of Avana, fed the imperial machine as it reached into the near and far seas. And, over the next 1,000 years, the ambitions of the empire gave birth to the single most powerful nation the barrier had ever seen.

#### To Lead Millions

Heading a nation of many million subjects is no small task. To accomplish this, the Brineflame Empire is led by an expansive council. On this council sits a councilmember representing every city with a population over 10,000, with the weight of each member’s vote being proportional to their city’s size. While not without its critics, this system has maintained relative order within the empire for over 1,000 years.

The empire also established the Brineflame Common tongue and a common currency, tying together disparate lands. The far-reaching influence of the empire means those they seek to assimilate often speak their language and use their coinage long before official diplomatic contact is had.

  

#### The Industrialization of a World

*A grinding mechanical abyss. A single point of failure.*

*Her lacerated hand tightened around the exposed rebar.*

*Another blast. A shake and a slip. A rush of adrenaline.*

*She felt for another hold among the debris.*

*A stable protrusion of serrated scrap. A bloody shred of hope.*

*With one sharp, final breath she reached upwards.*

*A dimming of sound and light. An end.*

The technological and societal developments of the Brineflame Empire influenced peoples across the barrier sea, with even Sunspire and Carthia adopting various imperial constructs. Now, all but the most remote corners of the world operate on Brineflame time and trade in Brineflame Tins. Even Carthia and Sunspire reluctantly employ imperial constructs, with the Brineflame tongue acting as the unofficial international language.

The imperial society, where status is based primarily on wealth, naturally led to a mostly oligarchic political structure. The ruling class, however, were not fools, and worked to ensure that none would go hungry. Even if this effort was mostly to ensure a steady stream of labor, it worked to placate the masses, and only allowed a small percentage of the population to fall through the cracks.

#### Maintaining an Empire

Whether one agrees or not with the empire’s methods, it is undeniable that they have brought prosperity and comfort to the barrier that has never before been seen on this scale. Even in the far seas, Archians enjoy modern tools and appliances to make their work and lives easier. This industry, however, comes at an increasingly apparent price. The world of the barrier is vast, but its resources are practically finite. Already, the empire strains to support itself, and the collection of wealth and power at the top seems as if it will topple the entire system.

With many of the lands worth taking already under imperial control, the empire has shifted its focus. Now, it spends most of its resources desperately attempting to maintain control. At any given time, there are at least a dozen famines and twice as many rebellions across the vast Brineflame Empire, and even the most comfortable imperial citizen is uncertain of their great nation’s future.

  

#### Figurehead of the Empire

The Brineflame empire maintains a ceremonial head of state role. This emperor or empress has no real power and serves as the face of the council for public relations. Eras of the empire are often defined by their leader at the time, regardless of how responsible they were for the happenings of the time.

When a standing emperor dies or abdicates their position, the council convenes to elect a new one. This new emperor can technically be any imperial citizen but is almost always a retired member of the council. Because of this, the emperor tends to carry a fair bit of political clout.

  

## 3.2  Imperial Institutions

In an attempt at efficiency, the empire has organized imperial corps and bureaus. Each corp or bureau is in charge of managing a single aspect of the empire and is headed by a senior imperial council member.

In theory, imperial corps manage responsibility related to the empire’s military and international relations, while bureaus mange internal, civilian affairs. In practice, these lines are often blurred.

### Imperial Corps

The military forces of the empire are vast and capable. The empire spares no expense on military and intelligence technologies, and fields forces and agents across the barrier.

#### II, the Imperial Intelligence Agency

The imperial intelligence agents have a simple, if not insurmountably difficult job: to know everything that is happening in every nation in the world. To reign their jurisdiction in a tad, this requirement is restricted to Archian happenings, with other institutions handling more exotic tasks.

Imperial intelligence agents are known for being everywhere rather than the skill of individual agents. Every nation knows they have an infestation, and that they could easily root out dozens of imperial actors given if they just allocated the resources. They also know that, in doing so, they would have achieved little more than drawn the empire’s ire.

  

#### IN, the Imperial Navy

*Sinew tore and bones cracked under a heavy gauntlet as the breaker caught the retreating rebel. Under the powered armor there was, allegedly, a living person. This person, however, felt nothing as they tore an arm from the socket of the screaming rebel fighter. The cries were cut short when the other gauntlet reduce the fighter’s head to a fleshy paste. Without a second thought, the breaker found its next targets: a wounded rebel and a panicking medic tending to them. There was always more work to be done.*

There are no dedicated land forces in the empire. All military activities are carried out by the imperial navy, a force with almost 1,000 ships in service. In addition to long-range sea-to-land weapons and carrier-based aerial forces, the navy employs a seemingly endless swathe of amphibious mechanized troops. While Sunspire and Carthia may boast better technology, there is no force in the world that can outmatch the sheer number of steel-clad marines employed by the imperial navy.

Brineflame’s elite marine soldiers are more machine the person, augmented far beyond the capabilities of ordinary Archians. In contrast to the careful arc-mechanical augmentations of Sunspire operatives, the Brineflame elite undergo intense, invasive, and often crude enhancements that leave them permanently disfigured and exceedingly dangerous. Commandos sport additional limbs mounted with deadly weaponry. Snipers bear implants that link them directly with their high-caliber rifles, their weapons becoming a literal extension of their bodies. And the infamous breakers, the most elite of Brineflame shock troopers, wear their armor as a second skin, their muscles fueled by industrial-strength steroids and stimulants. The imperial war machine has its fair share of critics, but the results of their conquests speak for themselves.

Most imperial forces are deployed far from the empire, in the near and far seas. In these lands, far from home, imperial soldiers fight ancient primordials and quell bloody rebellions, always searching for more land and resources for the ever-growing empire. There are few sovereign nations that can hold back the empire’s might, but the constant conflict and increasing decentralization of imperial power threatens a limit to the Brineflame Empire’s expansion.

The IN is the only imperial corp legally allowed to hold detainees. It maintains countless military prisons across imperial waters (and allegedly sites outside of its jurisdiction) that hold prisoners of war, domestic terrorists, and all manner of enemies to the state. They often work closely with the II, detaining high-value assets for the intelligence agency.

  

#### IM, the Imperial Medical Department

*“That’s a lotta blood, chief.”*

*A pale-faced sentinel forced a choked laugh as his partner desperately attempted to plug his wounds. “And I think you missed a few spots…”*

*“Fuck off. And keep your eyes open. I’m not wasting supplies on a damned corpse.”*

*A few more feverish moments passed before she realized she was, in fact, wasting supplies on a damned corpse.*

Imperials medics receive extensive training and are renowned for their ability to keep Archians alive against the grimmest of odds. They are obviously deployed to battlefields, but are also employed in international disaster relief efforts. These serve to improve international relations, especially with smaller nations that may one day serve as vassals to the growing empire.

In the recent centuries, heads of the IM had begun deploying permanent hospitals in major imperial cities. These hospitals may be freely used by any imperial citizen, and employ the same physicians that are posted on the front lines. While cold, efficient, and largely uncaring, these hospitals have addressed a long-ignored gap in civilian healthcare. Until their deployment, private hospitals, though offering a much more comprehensive and pleasant experience, catered only to the wealthy.

Public IM establishments have immensely increased the quality of life and life span of the average imperial citizen, and have been regarded as an immense success. Even the harshest critics cannot deny the impact they’ve had on the common people, though their existence does blue the line between international relations and internal affairs.
  

### Imperial Bureaus

Let no imperial citizen say that the empire does not invest in its people. For every Tin spent on the corps, there is some smaller fraction of a tin tossed to some imperial bureau, if only to keep the people placated.

#### IP, the Imperial Peacekeepers

Acting as a police force dedicated to maintaining order and internal security, peacekeepers have become increasingly militarized in recent centuries. As populations grow and dissent becomes more commonplace, peacekeepers are becoming increasing better-armed in order to oppose the many flavors of domestic terrorism that comes with a state teetering on the brink.

Along with the active policing of imperial citizens, the peacekeepers are in charge of the imperial correctional and internment facilities. While low-security facilities are often built within population centers, high-security facilities are almost always extremely remote.

The IP, similarly to the IN, has legal allowance to hold prisoners, but only for the sake of public safety. These facilities operate much more casually than the military prisons managed by the navy, with most detainees given leave to work their regular jobs. Those with no jobs are put to work on public projects, earning modest pay during their time. Those too dangerous to be released for work do low-paying menial work within the facility. It’s rare that detainees cannot be reintegrated into society, but those that are deemed too problematic are often permanently transferred to IN facilities.

#### IR, the Imperial Reserve

The imperial reserve, often simply referred to as the bank of the empire, manages and issues Tins. They are, surprisingly, the least contentious institution of the empire. There is ultimately little to criticize them for. They do their job fairly well, and refrain from the expansions of institutional power that the other corps and bureaus are known for.

  

#### IC, the Imperial Containment Committee

Though technically an internal committee dedicated to the safety and security of imperial citizens, little of publicly known about this committee. This has led to all sorts of conspiracy theories focused on the IC and its true nature, most of which are true.

In effect, the IC handles any exotic threat to the empire, such as those of cosmic or deep origins. They also handle any aberrant events. Of course, their every action is extremely classified.

The committee is given a blanket legal permission to hold any anomalous or otherwise unconventionally dangerous individual or object indefinitely. Due to the nature of the bureau, it need not report these holdings to any higher authority, and the lack of oversight often leads to abuse. The IC’s public relations suffer for this, but these worries are outweighed by the necessity of the institution.

#### IE, the Imperial Board of Education

Much of the success of the Brineflame Empire is due to its robust public education systems. These institutions have been fine-tuned to churn out highly skilled workers to feed modern labor demands. While it draws ire from critics for practices bordering on indoctrination, it remains one of the few imperials institutions in good standing with the public.

The IE covers everything from primary school to university academics, but it’s not the only player in academia. Private colleges and universities boast far more prestige than the public IE schools.

  

## 3.3  The Lands of the Empire

### Shalica, the Sundered Land

*A young valiant stared across the blue haze of a valley awash in moonlight. He was maybe twenty, accompanied by another man many years his elder.*

*"You know I won't live forever. We've been over this." The older valiant scanned their surroundings, taking note of every shadowed bluff and skittering critter. "I'm heading down now; this might be the last chance I get. You take care of yourself, kid."*

*The veteran descended into the valley and was quickly swallowed by the thick fog. The boy remained on the precipice, as if his mentor might emerge again. But the day broke, and the haze cleared, and the valley was quiet and empty.*

![[Shalica.png]]

The continent of Shalica sits roughly 500 miles north of the anchor. Though it seats two of the Brineflame Empire’s three sibling capitals, the continent of Shalica is a broken facsimile of the land it once was. It’s still-open wounds create a strange landscape, dotted with bustling cities and foreboding ruins alike.

The northern regions are Shalica are exceedingly remote and inhospitable. The earth still reels from the calamity of Avana, and horrors form the deep still crawl from the fissures it left. The few peoples that make their home in this region are no stranger to the constant threat of chaos, and are made hardy by the dangerous lands.

Southern Shalica, far from Avana’s crater, suffered comparatively little. While not untouched by catastrophe, it remains fairly lush and accommodating to the millions of people that call the land home.

#### Shalica’s Spine

One of the most prominent geographic features of Shalica is the nearly-impassable ridge that ruins north to south, bisecting the land. This veritable barrier is extremely rich in both iron ore and flashstone, and is the source of raw materials used across the central seas.

#### The Sister Bays of Shalica

Shalica boasts two large bays, separated only by Shalica’s Spine. To the east is the Spine Bay, a jagged and heavily-sheltered bay. If it weren’t for the razor-rocked shallows that line the cliffside coasts, this bay would make a perfect cradle for settlements. The reality is, however, that most boats wouldn’t survive the trip into or out of the bay.

The western Blackmaw Bay is less sheltered against the currents of the greater seas compared to the Spine Bay. Rich in marine life that takes advantage of shallow continental structures, the bay provides plenty of sustenance to the people of Shalica.

#### The Magnificently Toxic Blackhorn Peak

Dominating Shalica’s southwestern peninsula is a jet-black peak that towers over the rest of the continent. This mountain, known as Blackhorn Peak, rises five miles above sea level. More notable than its grand size is its mineral makeup, with the mountain being made almost entirely of pure blackstone. This mineral, usually an extreme rarity on the barrier, is both extremely neurotoxic and one of the most powerful naturally occurring disruptors of arcane fields.

The mountain and its surrounding foothills harbor very little life, inhabited only by a few specialized primordials. As such, efforts to harvest the valuable blackhorn from the mountain are extremely high-risk, with the air itself capable of completely paralyzing most creatures within minutes. Those with specialized equipment capable of filtering the toxic atmosphere must then contend with some of the most vicious primordials on Shalica.

  

#### The Ruptured Northwest

The lands of northeast Shalica are permanently marred, more so than any other region of the continent. At the northernmost point of the continent sits the epicenter of this ruin: the Sea of Madness. This crater sea marks what was once the site of Avana. Now, it’s little more than a whirling vortex, constantly leaking chaos form the deep into the world.

To the southwest of the Sea of Madness sit the remnants of an urban sprawl, now reduced to an expanse of rubble scarred with deep fissures. The only beings that exist in these wastes are dregs, who only serve to further the corruption of the region.

Beyond the dreg-infested wastes lay the jungles of Glissik, the home of the Vyld. While native warriors have successfully kept the dreg threat at bay, the corruption of the deep has begun gnawing at the edges of their kingdom. To the west of the jungles, in a region known as the Flayed Coast, the very earth of Shalica is slowly being shed in massive slabs. Most of these earthen chunks will eventually drift away from the continent. Given a few more eons, the jungles of Glissik may be little more than rogue islands, churning in the currents of the central sea.

There are a few relatively intact ruins dotting this hellish region, relics of Shalica’s catastrophic past. On the north coast, neat the inlet to the Sea of Madness, sits a ruined Selk port. Though the old docks still stand, there’s nothing here but dregs, and no sane captain would attempt to dock a vessel here. Opposite of this ruined port, nestled within hazardous peaks, sits an old astronomical spire. With no clear entry point, no modern researchers have dared investigate this strange structure. There also sits a mostly-intact observatory on a small island south of the Flayed Coast. While terribly remote and difficult to access, it lies in relatively safe waters and has been a hotspot for researchers from across the barrier (sans Sunspire, as the knowledge contained in the ruins of Shalica have been deemed heretical by the three orders). The dilapidated instruments contained in this observatory are still more precise than all but the most cutting-edge modern facilities on the barrier.

#### The Northeastern Lyra Desert

The Lyra Desert is a black-sanded wasteland that harbors little life, save for aggressively territorial primordials. In the canyons nearer to the Sea of Madness, the desert Primordials engage in skirmishes with the constant waves of dregs that emerge from the tumultuous waters.

At the eastern edge of the desert, on the point of a peninsula overlooking Blackmaw Bay, sits and ancient tower of Ingra construct. Here, a reclusive individual that has transcended mortality leads a small, cloistered commune.

#### The Southwestern Valleys

Twin valleys make up the southwestern region of Shalica. The western valley, still lush and bountiful, is home to many coexisting beasts and primordials. At the northern end of the valley is the Dreamer’s Lake, an incredibly deep lake that is rumored to lead to the very heart of the continent. At the southern end stands the Cosmic Spire, a ruined astronomical tower that is still guarded by incredibly advanced automata built during the golden age of Avana. During the night, it shines as a celestial beacon that can be seen hundreds of miles.

The eastern valley, isolated by some of the most aggressive ridges Shalica’s Spine has to offer, cradles a ruined Selk city. Though only a fraction of the size of Avana’s city center, this ruined metropolis sports legions of automata similar to those found in patrolling the Cosmic Spire. Many plunderers and researchers have braved the streets of this ruined city, it’s decaying storefronts still aglow with arcane signage. Very few of these brave individuals, however, have returned from the remote valley.

  

#### The Lowlands of Southeast Shalica

The gentlest, most accommodating lands in Shalica lie between the southern portion of Shalica’s Spine and the foreboding Blackhorn Peak. These lowlands are covered in fields and forests, and dotted with quaint and comfortable villages. This region was almost entirely spared the reckoning that came with the destruction of Avana.

Covering the southern coast of this low-lying region are the Floodbarrens. This marshy sub region floods regularly and is home to flourishing semi-aquatic life and wetland plants.

#### Alburn and the Lowland Settlements

*Two stargazers sat together on a beach. An easterly wind had carried Alburn’s smog to their sky, so they instead watched the tide come in.*

*“You know, the water’s not actually rising.”*

*“Yeah, yeah, you’ve told me before. We’re sinking, or whatever.”*

*“No, not sinking, floating. Up and down, every day and night.”*

*Some time passed, and the tide rose up to meet their feet.*

*“Do you think we’ll ever sink?”*

Alburn is the capitol city of Shalica, and one of the greatest cities on the Brineflame Empire. It serves as trade capital of the known world, dealing in both the exchange of physical goods and widely sought-after knowledge. The latter product coalesces within the Imperial Records library, one of the grandest collections of information on the barrier.

Due to its strategic position near the borders of Sunspire waters, Alburn houses a strong garrison and serves as a forward operating base for the imperial navy. The imperial shipyards of Alburn rival those of Brine, and churn out some of the most impressive vessels to sail the barrier seas.

Most of the city benefits from sophisticated creature comforts, from electric appliances to arcane automata. Streets are lined with all manner of amenities, from elegant boutiques and upscale cafes to secondhand markets and corner store delis. Alburn is also home to the original valiant guild hall, which serves as the operating base for some of the most well-known valiant companies on the barrier. Many artisan shops specializing in adventuring gear earn nearly all of their revenue providing equipment to these valiants.

In the lowlands overseen by Alburn are many smaller settlements. While most of these are farming towns or trade settlements situated on the main roads, there are a handful of notable cities between Alburn and Southstar. The town of Cromst, situated almost exactly between Alburn and Southstar, is a farming town recently turned burgeoning city, it’s growth driven by those attempting to escape the bustle of Alburn and Southstar. Situated far to the south of Alburn is the quiet walled city of Getsan. This city, once a Hjark outpost, is home primarily to agricultural barons, with most of its population consisting of seasonal workers.

  

#### Southstar and the Settlements of the Valley

The original home of the Hjark, Southstar is the oldest active settlement on Shalica. Nestled deeply into the ore-rich ridges of Shalica’s Spine, this city serves equally as a fortress and a bastion of industry. The grand forges of Southstar supply high quality steel to the central seas, by the way of Alburn’s ports. The primary keep of Southstar, an establishment known as the Foundry, is the home of the imperial flame council. From this iron spire, the council oversees the industrial progress of the entire empire.

West of Southstar, beyond the Dreamer’s Lake, is the small city of Ros. This settlement was long ago formed of rugged folk seeking an escape from the modern world. There is little communication to or from Ros, with the settlement being almost entirely self-sufficient. Dotting the road from Southstar to Ros are similar, smaller settlements.

Far to the south or Ros, beyond the Cosmic Spire, one can find the Fool’s Cove. This remote port is a favorite haunt of many seafaring outlaws. Its remoteness, combined with the danger of navigating the coastal shallows of Spine Bay, make it a safe-haven for those attempting to hide from imperial law. The shanty town operates on a very loose code of honor that only just barely holds the place together. It also holds one of the most prominent black markets in the central seas, where all sorts of stolen artifacts are peddled.

#### The Remote Northern Cities

While inhospitable, northern Shalica is not quite devoid of life. In the shade of the Lyra Desert’s canyons, the Ingra commune of Eris attracts masterful warriors from across the barrier. It’s only promise is a never-ending hunt for the most dangerous dregs one can find this close to the anchor.

Though struggling against the tides of corruption, the Vyld’s jungle kingdom of Glissik still boasts a population in the millions. These Vyld, however, keep to themselves in their treetop cities, entirely untrusting of outsiders after the Selk-wrought catastrophe and started the slow unravelling of their homeland.

#### Port Settlements of the Sister Bays

The ports of Shalica’s twin bays act as remote arms of the Brineflame Empire. They are almost all remote settlements, subsisting primarily off of trade agreements and the bounty of the sea.

Spine Bay hosts two sister ports, with southern Shalica’s Grim’s Landing servicing a barebones landing in northern Shalica. Grim’s landing, originally established by a Brineflame naval captain as a forward operating base, has grown into a military town settled by the families of Brineflame soldiers. It’s used almost exclusively as a staging ground for operations in northwestern Shalica. Due to the nature of the region, very few of these excursions return. The grim nature of the base and the general attitude of its populace has earned the port its name and somber atmosphere.

In the larger Blackmaw Bay, the Brineflame Empire controls the strategic ports of Larsan and Steelport. Larsan is a heavily fortified Brineflame garrison that oversees mining and research operations at Blackhorn Peak, while Steelport is a simpler labor settlement established by the empire in an effort to extract even more iron from Shalica’s Spine.

Established by independent explorers for the purpose of exploring northeastern Shalica is the port of Blackbeach. It was quickly found that the region hosted only harsh deserts occupied by vicious primordials. However, when explorers made contact with the Ingra commune of Eris, the port settlement of Blackbeach grew into a moderately prosperous trading center. Here, the dreg hunters of Eris trade rare, unstable materials taken from their quarries for tools and supplies.

  

# 4    The Contending Nations

Keeping the Brineflame Empire in check are the nations of Carthia and Sunspire. Though both nations are dwarfed by the expansiveness of the empire, each boasts their own respective prowess and accomplishments.

While direct conflict is often far too costly to be considered by any major power on the barrier, these three nations are no strangers to proxy wars and skirmishes over territories outside of the central seas.

## 4.1  Carthia
![[Pasted image 20241024223137.png]]

Carthia is an exceedingly neutral nation built upon genesis forge technology, Generally speaking, Carthia is a nation that is largely content with its current state, having little ambition to grow or to conquer. With most aspects of daily life automated by ancient technologies, the citizens of Carthia want for nothing and are free to pursue their individual passions.

This comfort of this nation, however, was not earned peacefully. The entirety of northern Uthren, its fiery wounds still open, is a testament to the danger of the ancient powers Carthians wield. Even in modern times, other nations are fearful to interact with Carthia due to the catastrophes it wrought in its past.

### The Founding of the City of Carthia

Carthia, beginning as a small settlement founded by some of the first Marr during the Archian Dawn, is one of the oldest cities on the barrier. It’s growth into the modern sprawling metropolis was expedited by early incursions into the genesis forge below Uthren.

#### A Village of Marr

For the first several hundred years of its existence, the hamlet of Carthia was quaint and comfortable. Marr went about their lives with ease, cradled in the lush forested valleys of central Uthren. It wasn’t until the arrival of other Archian lineages introduced some semblance of ambition that the city began growing in earnest.

It didn’t take long for explorers to discover the sprawling genesis forges buried under the mountain around Carthia, and by the end of the first millennium after the Dawn, Carthia had grown into a proper metropolis, governed as a city-state by a small council of bold Archians, only a few of which bore any Marr ancestry.

  

#### The Genesis of Superweapons

It took less than one hundred years for the council of Carthia to order the genocide of one of their neighbors. Not content with simply using genesis technologies for civil purposes, the council commissioned the creation of a weapon. Their intent was to dissuade the Derge kingdoms to their north from any further marauding. For hundreds of years the Derge’s steel and martial prowess had been able to match Carthian technology, but the council aimed to put them in their place with a grand show of power.

This show of power, however, would leave almost nobody left that could fear it. A bomb fashioned out of an unstable primordial heart scavenged from the deepest reach of the genesis forges was flown to northern Uthren via airship, where it was dropped just beyond the border of the southernmost Derge kingdoms.

When detonated, this weapon utterly changed the landscaped of northern Uthren. Snowy peaks were sheared, and great rifts opened. The land was left as a swirling mess of fire and ice, showing no signs of ever stabilizing. The few derge that weren’t obliterated retreated from Uthren, with only a small handful of families remaining in their homeland in a crazed attempt to tame their new surroundings.

### A More Reserved Modern Carthia

The annihilation of the Derge kingdoms of northern Uthren marked a turning point in Carthia’s history. To this day, it remains the last offensive action ever taken by the city-state. Now, the academics of Carthia focus entirely on defensive military advancements and the study peacetime applications of genesis technologies.

#### The New Council of Carthia

Seeing the awesome destructive potential of the technology their nation sat upon, the level-headed people of Carthia regained control of their nation. This was relatively easy, as the disgraced council was all but denounced by the Carthian people for their actions against the Derge kingdoms.

The new council of Carthia understood that a passive role would not prevent future catastrophe, and began devising laws to ensure a peaceful future. Any offensive military act was outlawed, and it was made mandatory that all automata built from materials dug from the genesis forge were programmed to be purely defensive, only protecting Carthian territory and enforcing Carthian law.

The council also took this time to establish themselves as an official nation. They marked borders, codified governance, and marked themselves as a powerful neutral nation on the barrier. The Carthian tongue was also devised during this period, acting as a simplified common denominator of the now-diverse Carthian people. It is likely that this language would have spread across the barrier and become the common tongue of the seas, were it not for the new, isolationism of Carthia.

The nation of Carthia continued on this course to the present day, keeping to itself for several stable millennia. The only time the Carthian defense forces left their borders was during the Avana disaster, roughly 3,500 years after the Archian Dawn. Carthian forces were dispatched to aid the survivors of the calamity, leveraging their advanced technology to help stabilize the dying land. This act helped to greatly improve their image, replacing their past transgressions in the minds of the international community.

  

#### Carthia’s Modern International Relations

The destruction caused by Carthia against their northern neighbors was felt across the central seas. The violet flash and subsequent fireball could be seen for thousands of miles in every direction on the flat oceans, and shockwaves were felt as far away as Shalica. When news spread to the other, infant nations, the chief response was fear. No other people were capable of anything remotely close to the powerful display of the Carthians, and all were careful not to draw their eye.

Significant time, and Carthia’s aid after the destruction of Avana, has mostly healed international relations. The Brineflame Empire engages in trade and regular diplomacy with Carthia, though Carthian law does not permit the exchange of any genesis forge technologies. Sunspire, governed by its strict orders, disallows any interactions with the heretical Carthians on grounds of their usage of the banned ancient technology. Sunspire does, however, have close alliances with a few of the Uthren city-states that border Carthia. From there, Eldest Star agents keep close tabs on Carthian activities.

Carthia’s relations with other sovereign peoples on Uthren is strained due to their utter dominance of the continent and iron-gripped control over the buried forges. Despite their best efforts, Carthian tech is occasionally taken from their lands during skirmishes with these sovereign states, and it inevitably makes its way to black markets to fund further strife on Uthren.

### The Carthian Watch

The Carthian Watch is an autonomous force that comprises the bulk of Carthia’s military power. These towering soldiers have been perfected by Carthian engineers over millennia, and are contenders for the most powerful single pieces of military hardware on the modern barrier. Due to the scarcity of genesis material with which to construct them, however, they are relatively few. By Carthia’s official counts, less than a hundred units make up the Carthian Watch, supported by several thousand Archian personnel.

Though they are made chiefly to protect Carthia, the Watch also act as an internal peacekeeping force. They act as judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to criminal matters, resolving them with brutal efficiency. The only way to truly evade persecution by the watch to leave Carthia, and never return. This efficient crackdown keeps the crime rate of Carthia near zero, at the expense of terrifying most people who haven’t grown up around the eternally patrolling sentinels.

#### Deity Class Watchers

While every member of Carthian Watch is unique, there are three of the Watch that stand well-above the rest. These deity-class units are the only constructs on the Watch that have a general intelligence, able to think relatively freely. This intelligence is (allegedly) reigned in, disallowing them to make any actions beyond defensive ones.

The deity-class Watchers are responsible for the direct control of every other unit in the Carthian Watch. For this reason, they are deployed exclusively within Carthia itself, where they sit motionless as silent minds. Should need arise, they would serve as an unassailable final defence of Carthia.

#### Agents Against Chaos

Carthian Watch units are uniquely capable against the forces of the deep. Due to their construction of components from the genesis forge, they are extremely resistant to deep influences and have protected Carthia from many incursions throughout its history. They are not, however, immune to corruption, and in a few cases deep-touched Watchers have been put down by the Carthian Watch.

  

## 4.2  Sunspire

![[Pasted image 20241024223156.png]]
The land that was once home of the original Selk now harbors a nation governed by the Sunspire orders. After the catastrophe of Avana, most surviving Selk returned to the safety of their homeland where they established a new order to protect themselves from their past mistakes.

The strict order imposed in Sunspire makes it difficult for the nation to engage in trade and cooperation with other lands. Order agents block any trace of heretical technologies, such as those widely employed by Carthia, from entering Sunspire-controlled lands. Even outside of Sunspire borders, agents hunt those who study forbidden knowledge.

### Sunspire Before the Orders

Sunspire first existed as a city-state. Founded by descendants of the original Selk tribe, it was built at the highest point of the continent of Sunspire.

#### The Continental City-State

After its establishment a few hundred years post-Archian Dawn, the city served as the governing head of the united continent of Sunspire. Bearing the same name as the land it was built on, the white-gold towers of the city began to represent the soaring purity of the small, mountainous continent.

This purity, however, bordered on xenophobia. Foreign diplomats were the only people let into the city proper, with travelers and merchants forced to do business in the smaller towns and cities far below the mountain city of Sunspire.

#### Establishing Avana

About 2,000 years after the Archian Dawn, Selk hailing form Sunspire established Avana. In the new city’s early days, it acted as a colony of Sunspire. Resources were funneled to the small port city, and Avana grew slowly and steadily. Then, a routine dig unearthed the entrance to Shalica’s genesis forge. Having no forge under Sunspire, this resource was new to the people of Sunspire. And, by this time, almost a thousand years had passed since the superweapon unleashed by Carthia had shaken the central seas.

The Selk handled this technology responsibly for over a thousand years. During this time, Avana grew to dwarf Sunspire. Things continued in this way until roughly 3,500 years after the Dawn, when Avana pushed its genesis technology to its limits in an attempt to finally wipe out their rivals on Shalica. The resulting arcane fallout fractured the continent and annihilated the greatest civilization on the barrier overnight.

  

### The Orders of Sunspire

Following the disaster wrought on Shalica by Avana’s genesis technology, Sunspire once again became the capital of Selk society. Leaders on Sunspire considered Avana’s greatest failings to be twofold: the usage of technology not wrought by their own hands, and the welcoming of other, lesser peoples into their society.

To rectify this, the strict orders of Sunspire were established, which govern the nation to this day.

#### The Founding of the Sunspire Orders

Back on the small, mountainous continent of Sunspire, local leaders had witnessed the fall of Avana with their own eyes. The horrific awe brought on by the singularity that erased a city was burned forever into the minds of these Selk. As they accepted Shalican refugees, they began work on a system that would forever outlaw the exploration of the ancient technologies that scarred Shalica.

Only a few years after the incident on Shalica, the Sunspire orders were officially established and granted total control over the nation. These orders, fashioned after the longstanding Selk societal roles, would govern Sunspire for as long as the white-gold towers stood. To be a citizen of Sunspire means belonging wholly to one of its orders, dedicating one’s life utterly to the doctrines of that order.

Under the authoritarian guidance of the three orders, Sunspire flourishes at the cost its foreign relations.

#### The Order of the Sun

Overseeing the material needs of Sunspire was the Order of the Sun. Belonging to this order was everything from farmers to military engineers. To foreign people, the Order of the Sun is known mostly as the military arm of Sunspire, as it is also responsible for both internal and external security. The modern accomplishments of the Order of Sun include everything from automated agricultural constructs to experimental arcane fighter jets (often referred to as arcjets). The need for manual labor in Sunspire has been nearly eliminated by this order, and the order’s military constructs stands sentinel any invaders, whether they be from the barrier or beyond.

Above all else, the Order of the Sun demands stoicism in the face of a world that is cold and uncaring. It is the duty of this order’s members to be a shining beacon to the people of Sunspire, such that none could lose their way. It is also anathema to members of this order to hold any living being against their will. This means that there are (almost) no prisons in Sunspire. Those that go against the order are banished, executed, or must offer themselves up for rehabilitation.

#### The Order of the Moon

A natural counterpart to the Order of the Sun, the Order of the Moon provides spiritual aid and governance to the people of Sunspire. This includes some services that bridge into the material, such as healthcare and history-keeping. This was the first order to be properly established after the catastrophe at Avana and is responsible for much of the rescue efforts on Shalica.

Those that belong to the Order of the Moon hold compassion in the highest regard. To be a member of this order means to put the well-being of those in need above all else. Members of this order are the only Sunspire citizens allowed to regularly interact with foreigners outside of combat scenarios, as it is their duty to extend a gracious, healing hand to the lowly and needy peoples outside of Sunspire’s borders.

  

#### The Order of the Eldest Star

The enigmatic Order of the Eldest Star, named after Astida, is extremely secretive, even within Sunspire. Members of the other orders rarely interact with Eldest Star operative, and often only tolerate the necessary extremes members of this order go to in order to root out heresy. As it is, ultimately, the Order of the Eldest Star’s duty to defend Sunspire and its neighbors (whether or not they desire it) from the dangers of genesis forge technologies and other forces deemed in opposition to the people of the barrier. The deep, vault-like underground establishments of the Order of the Eldest Star house enough anomalous artifacts to frighten even the hardiest Carthian artificer.

To members of this order, there is only one rule: to defend the sanctity of world at any cost. This means they are the only exception to the otherwise steadfast rule of Sunspire that prohibits the detaining of any unwilling person.

### A Modern Society of Selk

While the blood of the original Selk has been somewhat diluted over the millennia, the people of Sunspire still claim an almost entirely Selk heritage. This pursuit of purity imparts a heightened sense of purpose to even the simplest of Sunspire’s people, at the cost of preventing any sort of progression via cultural diversity.

#### Isolationism in Practice

Sunspire rarely shares much of anything with the outside world. They rarely trade, and hoard their technological advancements in their arcane laboratories. However, no isolation is perfect, and the wonders drafted up by Sunspire’s arc-engineers inevitably make their way outside of the nation. From armaments to medicine, bastardizations of Sunspire tech can be found throughout the seas. Still, none of these counterfeits measure up to the artisan goods produced in Sunspire.

#### Utterly Artisan

There is no concept of mass-production in Sunspire. With only a few million total citizens, there is simply no need. Instead, everything produced, from food to tools, is done so by skilled artisans. Every arcane rifle, and every civil servant automata are made to order.

To foreigners, this gives an otherworldly aspect to Sunspire and its people. The few diplomats allowed in Sunspire proper are left in awe for years, and imperial soldiers often recount their defeat by Sunspire forces fondly, still wondering at the amazing armaments employed by the golden armies of the Order of the Sun.

#### Mastery Over Life

In contrast to the sun order’s tools of war, the order of the moon’s researchers develop tools and techniques to control life itself. Expert arc-physicians can conduct complex surgeries without a single incision, manipulating arcane forces to rectify internal injuries non-invasively. Arcane-biological specialists elegantly marry flesh with arcane implants, transcending the physical limitations imposed upon Archians by the third child. In extreme cases, the minds of Archians have been transplanted into entirely artificial bodies.

#### Primordial Bonds

The people of Sunspire have a very unique relationship with the primordials of the barrier. Sunspire is the only nation able to consider itself generally allied with primordials, and is the only nation where Archians working alongside primordials as equals is commonplace. It’s not uncommon for Sunspire’s arc-engineers to implant the heart of a willing primordial into various types of critical arcane machinery, with the most interesting example being arcjets, where primordials act as both the power source and as a co-pilot for an Archian operator.

  

# 5    International Institutions and Organizations

On the modern barrier, traditional borders are little more than suggestions, and allegiances and ideas are easily spread to even the most isolated and remote of places.

## 5.1  Major Faiths of the World

*An imperial inquisitor kneeled behind a desk in a pool of his own blood, his right hand pushing hard against a hole is his gut. One of his hands lay limp, several feet away. With a deep gasp, he summoned his remaining courage and spoke:*

*"Heretic, you only bring upon yourself an unimaginable suffering! Your dark deeds here will be buried, and righteous retribution will singe your flesh eternal! There is no hope for you! No amount of repentance shall save your soul! I wanted only your salvation, but with the lives you have ended this night, I fear that will never come for you."*

*Muffled laughter blended with the sound of soft, squelching footsteps approaching the desk. Having spent all he had; the inquisitor could only manage a whimper before his skull was caved in.*

In the roughly eight millennia the Archians have existed on the barrier, they have established all manner of faiths and religious doctrines. Most of these never grow beyond small, regional beliefs. There are, however, a handful of these faiths that have found a foothold internationally. These major faiths serve to further complicate the already twisted webs of culture that span the barrier.

### The Way of Stone and Flame

One of the oldest practiced faiths on the barrier is the Hjark-founded way of stone and flame, often shortened to The Way for simplicity. The ancient Hjark understood their place on the barrier, and strived to work together with the natural world in harmony. Their efforts in maintaining sustainability and the general stewardship of their lands culminated in a self-sustaining theory of industry, the likes of which allowed them millennia of progress with almost zero long-term consequences or setbacks.

Ancient followers of the way understood that the health their world and the primordials that defended it were vital to their own continued existence. Nothing was taken that was not needed, and nothing was extracted that could not be regenerated. The oldest and wisest followers understood that even the land they built their homes upon was primordial flesh, and that if cared for properly it would continue to sustain them in perpetuity.

#### The Propagation of The Way’s Principles Across the Seas

As groups of Hjark left Shalica to settle in faraway lands, they began mingling with the other peoples of the barrier. Everywhere they settled, their masterful crafts inspired indigenous peoples. It wasn’t long before the basic principles encoded by ancient Hjark long ago became commonplace in blossoming industries throughout the seas.

From Sunspire to Carthia, engineers studied the methods of the first Hjark. In every major city, universities dedicated to the teachings of the way could be found. This code, focused more on the material, was able to coexist with the myriad other spiritual beliefs found across the barrier.

  

#### The Modern Corruption of The Way

In the modern Brineflame Empire, and in many smaller developed nations, the old principles of the way have been mangled to suit modern desires. The knowledge once used to promote harmony and sustainability is now used to further exploit the world’s resources for short-term benefits. Extensive mining efforts cut deeply and greedily into rocky flesh, and regular primordial heart harvests cull local populations, driving primordials to near-extinction around populated regions and threatening future scarcities of the precious energy sources.

There are fundamentalists of The Way throughout the modern barrier that resist the ravaging of the world by modern industrialists. These groups are often demonized and labeled extremists, yet they work tirelessly and selflessly on the fringes of society to ensure that their descendants may yet inherit a world that can support them. The efforts of these fundamentalists range from peaceful protests in city centers to brazen acts of eco-terrorism.

### The Genesis Church

The city of Carthia, uniquely positioned atop one of the grandest genesis forges, quickly developed a deep devotion to the ancient technology found within the strange buried foundry. What began with handy folk repurposing strange tools to automate simple tasks eventually evolved into a cult-like fascination with the impossibly advanced artifacts buried beneath their feet.

Soon after the discovery of the forge, people organized to study and regulate artifact extraction. These groups evolved and converged until the Church was established. This formal religious organization recognized the ruins below them as evidence of an almighty creator that built this world and the people that inhabit it. The church believes that this ancient, genius creator is currently in a long period of slumber, evidenced by the long-inactive forges. Thus, it falls to the official artificers of the Church to responsibly excavate the long-lost tools of the creator and use them for the betterment of all people.

#### The Northern Calamity and the Reformation of the Church

Following the hurried development and deployment of the weapon that destroyed northern Carthia, the Church underwent a tumultuous period of introspection and reform. Up until this point, the council of Carthia included lead Church artificers who acted as both leaders of the state and the Church. After the rash decisions leading up to the northern calamity and decimation of the Derge, the Church leaders left the council and reduced their public influence, turning their focus purely to the safe extraction and repurposing of artifacts.

The new Church operates under two branches. The first branch is devoted to the truth of the creator, running institutions across the barrier that spread the word of the church. The influence of this social institution is an annoyance to some, while a cornerstone to the lives of others. Ultimately, it causes little objective harm on the modern barrier due to widespread retraction of all but the mildest tenets. The primary topic of its modern scriptures is the maintenance of stability, proposing that the people of the barrier exist as custodians for the world built by the creator.

The second branch of the Church focuses on the safe study of the genesis forges across the barrier, employing all matter of specialists to facilitate the extracting and research of genesis forge artifacts. This branch operates in relative confidentiality, with Church knowledge being closely guarded to avoid it falling into nefarious hands. The Church often finds itself at odds with Sunspire’s Order of the Eldest Star, with the two forces regularly coming into conflict.

  

#### The Rogue Splinters of the Carthian Church

As the technological branch of the Church employs many individuals, it is inevitable that it suffers the eventual defector. These individuals often escape with small, key technologies, usually with the intention of a black-market payday. Most of the technology these agents escape with eventually ends up in the hands of government research agencies or hot-shot valiants with too much coin to spend.

There are, however, more organized groups that employ church defectors. These organizations operate in extreme secrecy, evading the eyes of local governments and international watchdogs. The largest among these groups, and a current high-priority target of Sunspire’s Order of the Eldest Star, is an organization operating out of the ruined Selk cities of Shalica. This group, known as the Children of Avana, pores over the past sins of Avana. They are one of the most prolific terroristic organizations on the barrier, known even to laypeople beyond the central seas.

### The Celestial Faith of the Three Principles

Most people view the strict law of Sunspire’s orders as draconian and authoritarian. However, the spiritual components of the orders manage to find a widespread following abroad. This adoption outside of Sunspire’s borders is in no small part due to the allure of order and sense in a wildly unpredictable world.

The celestial faith is not something intentionally designed by Sunspire, and exists as standalone system of belief that is followed across the oceans. The citizens of Sunspire, as inherent members of the three orders, consider the celestial faith a bastardization of their way of life, often detesting it and its followers outright.

#### The Three Principles as a Singular Faith

The celestial faith diverges from Sunspire’s orders greatly, interpreting the orders as three cosmic principles that create a whole. The first principle, the principle of the sun, is the principle of light and law. Followers of the celestial faith believe completely in an immutable order that governs all of the cosmos, and that this order is paramount as life itself is only made possible when order triumphs over chaos. Depending on the specific denomination, this principle may also include a set of material, earthly laws that must be followed (sometimes without exception).

The second principle of the faith is the principle of the moon. This principle is one of purpose and comfort, bestowing upon believers a place in the grand cosmic structure, and a promise of eternal existence as cosmic energy after death. This principle, often the primary draw of the faith, posits that all people are meant to be, and that all people are deserving of compassion and understanding. It is this second principle that is most often cited by adherents when the belief is faced with criticism.

The third and final principle, the principle of the eldest star, is often omitted in common practice. This principle states that it is the responsibility of every faithful to scorn the unfaithful. This concept is seen as mostly unpalatable, with no place in the modern world. Some fundamentalists still cling to this principle, believing that the ascension of all Archians relies on a total unification through the celestial faith.

  

### The Deep Creed of Anarchy

The deep, while not inherently evil, is feared across the barrier. The uncaring chaos it spawns is an annoyance to even the luckiest folk. However, there are those that embrace the unpredictability of the abyss below. Some of these people act as individuals, while others form loose organizations with like-minded cohorts. Regardless, they all posit that chaos is necessary, perhaps even more so than order.

The tenets of the creed are inherently dangerous to the established nations of the world. These people, labelled almost universally as extremists, wish to do away with the structures that choke the common person. They rage against the bureaucratic machine, unflinching in their faith in chaos.

#### A Family Steeped in Chaos

Followers of the deep cast off all social ties, becoming a part of a new family of likeminded anarchists. This family webs throughout the barrier, consistently attracting individuals failed by the system. Local governments and peacekeeping forces spare no expense in quelling anarchist activity, but the enigmatic groups that operate under the creed are as difficult to pin down as the roiling abyss itself.

Many sects of the creed partake in deep rituals, beckoning the chaos from below. The rituals themselves are never recorded, for record-keeping in any form is anathema to the creed. Instead, these rituals are developed and perfected over time by local groups, with certain long-standing families wielding terrifying power via their mastered rituals. It’s rare, however, for any powerful group to utilize the full potential of their rituals, as doing so would often undermine their efforts and destroy their family knowledge. Only the most deep-taken, maddened groups would sacrifice generations of work to cause what is ultimately temporary regional instability. Groups that do not take measures to preserve their sanity, however, are doomed to meet this fate, as regularly interacting with the deep will rapidly deteriorate one’s mind.

#### The New Creed

While very few identify with the vehemently anti-establishment ideology of the creed, the ideas of personal liberties and mutual aid are widely palatable in most modern societies. An increasing number of common people are identifying with a new, softer version of the deep creed. This modified version seeks social justice within the bounds of existing systems, rather than the destruction of those systems.

Unfortunately for the champions of personal freedoms, they often find resistance on multiple fronts. Their secondhand association with the deep causes most folk to disregard them, and their softening of creed tenets draws ire from staunch anarchistic adherents.

  

## 5.2  International Organizations

While most organizations across the barrier are not technically limited by national borders, there are only a few that can be considered truly and practically international. These groups wield significant power and influence across the seas, operating under the protection of neutrality. This neutrality, however, is often brought into question for the largest organizations.

### Honor

Members of honor, referred to as the honorbound, are respected arbiters among the civilized regions of the barrier. Holding no allegiance to any state, they act as mediators and international watchdogs. Boasting their own standing military and strict code of conduct, they wield a frightening amount of influence in the near seas where they primarily operate.

In the central seas, honor avoid flexing any sort of military might and instead focuses on the maintenance of their chapter courthouses. In these institutions, present in nearly every major city, honorbound establish a neutral ground where matters of international law may be carried out. While it’s not necessarily known where honor’s funds come from, its widely rumored that their forces partake in regular campaigns into the minor genesis forges of the far seas, selling their findings on the black market.

### The Free Seas Trade Union

The trade union began as a coalition disgruntled Girt merchants who felt disenfranchised by the increasing regulations of the Brineflame Empire. Though it originally held disdain for imperial ports and operated primarily in the free seas, the union eventually put aside its contempt for the empire due to the promise of an expanded market.

The modern trade union is a well-established and trusted third party, serving the barrier in trade and logistics. They act as the primary mediators in the commodity market, and their vaults and banks are among the most trusted in all of the seas.

  

### Valiants

*A lone figure, bearing heavy grenadier armor draped in gray cloth, sifted through rubble. She shifted, adjusting the massive blade slung over her shoulder, and brushed the ash from the insignia of a fallen soldier. A Sunspire officer. Her objective was nearby.*

*The scout’s radio buzzed as he peered through the heavy smog. “I found the officer. Meet me at the flare, and watch out for scavengers.” The scout took a deep breath of fresh air, the last he’d get before heading into the city below. He fiddled with his rifle idly, peering into the labyrinthian streets from his perch. After a few brief moments, he spotted a red glow through the fog and shook awake a well-dressed man lying next to him. “It’s time to go, doctor.” The two collected their things and descended into the fog below.*

Beneath the webs of geopolitics, independent mercenary-adventurers work for the highest bidder. They operate in small groups with visceral efficiency, demanding a high price for their dangerous line of work. While many valiants are maimed, killed, or otherwise forced to retire young, veteran valiants are among the most powerful (and sometimes influential) individuals in the Barrier.

The original valiant guild house was established in Alburn, Shalica, thousands of years before it became the heart of the modern Brineflame Empire. Since then, a franchised network of guild houses has spread throughout the central seas and into the more populated regions of the near seas. These guild houses act as middlemen between potential clients and valiant companies.

  

# 6    The Blurred Edges of the World

*“I’m tellin ya, friend, there’re things out there, more than water and darkness. I can take ya to the edge, but I ain’t goin no further than that.”*

*Wordlessly, the valiant dropped hefty pouch of coin in front of the old seadog. Paper money wasn’t any good this far out, but the clinging of coin caught the old man’s attention.*

*“Ok, I can take ya a little bit past the edge, but I turn around at the first sign of trouble”*

Far from the gaze of the cosmic engine, alien beings from beyond the veil of the world poke and prod at the Architect’s quaint little creation. The boldest of these beings push closer to the center of the world, their existence a stain on realms they disgrace with their presence.

## 6.1  Rogue Aberrations

While the world is fairly resilient to intrusion, it is not impenetrable. Aberrations, beings from other worlds, are known to rarely intrude upon this one. While not all of them are necessarily hostile, they rarely have good intentions.

There are a few known categories of aberrants, though their alien bodies and minds resist most efforts to understand them.

### Avatars

Avatars appear rarely on the barrier, as physical manifestations of higher-order beings. These manifestations tend to have simple forms and are indestructible. They can only be slowed in their endeavors while their source leaves them inert.

#### Type-1 “Wrath” Avatars

Gore avatars are mostly featureless beings with white heads baring two red eyes. Their heads are tucked deeply into their torsos, with the tops of their scalp flush with their shoulders. They are large and very physically capable, sporting a pair of long arms that end in simple stubs. While their size varies, the smallest among them easily dwarf the largest archians.

When left to whatever inscrutable task they are attending to, gore avatars are docile and inattentive. Any interruption to this sends them into an unstoppable rage. They will tear through anything and everything that moves, until they are eventually satisfied. While indestructible, they can be stilled by overwhelming force such that it’s clear they have met their match.

  

#### Type-2 “Gore” Avatars

Wrath avatars enter the world as tall, gangly bipedal creatures that resemble a stretched archian. Most of their height is comprised of legs that end in bony points, while their torsos are shallow and short. They have numerous sets of long-reaching arms, and their pale white skin appears stretched over their alien frames. They have no head, instead hosting a mass of churning shadows resting atop their torsos.

For an arbitrary time, ranging from weeks to centuries, the young wrath avatar wanders the world as incredibly hostile nomads. Eventually, they settle in a region for reason unknowable. The settled region transforms into a dark, mock ecosystem inhabited manifestations that match the avatar’s innate hostility. Over time, the avatar and its realm grow until the avatar reaches maturity.

A wrath avatar’s already formidable power is multiplied in its maturity. It’s racing mind is honed to an atomic edge, and its suffocating shadows reach every inch of their domain. Its now-vestigial legs rot off as it achieves a passive levitation. The black mass that substitutes its head now drips down its torso and arms, puppeteering what remains of its body. At this point, the wrath avatar’s territory becomes extremely hostile and entirely uninhabitable to any outside life.

A wrath avatar can disconnected from its source, which is impossible without the aid of some higher power. Alternatively, most leave after a few millennia, after they’ve achieved whatever goal it is that brought them here.

### Breachers

Breachers are alien creatures with the capability to force themselves into the world from somewhere beyond the edge of space and time. While they have some purpose, their alien makes it difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.

Once it has achieved its goal in this world, a breacher will leave as suddenly as it arrived, often leaving a wake of destruction as these beings care little for the sanctity of this world. While they are universally dangerous, even when not immediately hostile, breachers are coveted for the alien materials they bring into the world. Both the body parts of a breacher, and any tools it may bring along with it, are exotic artifacts of otherworldly properties.

#### Type-1 “Devourer” Breacher

Devourers are dangerous breachers that, after entering the world, immediately begin to devour anything they can find. Their form varies, ant they are more animalistic and less intelligent than other types of breachers. Their only purpose is to consume.

As devourers feed, they rapidly mutate into larger, more dangerous forms, inheriting characteristics of the things they consume. Individual devourers have specific tastes, with diets ranging from organic matter to saltwater.

If left to finish its feast, a devourer will eventually leave the world just as suddenly as it arrived. Only young devourers have been observed to enter the world.

  

### Singulars

*It walked from room to room, stepping carefully over smoldering bodies. On its way to the front door, it passed a crooked painting to its left. The work was scorched beyond recognition, but something about it drew the intruder's gaze. It touched a single soot-stained finger to the surface of the blackened canvas. For a moment, it felt regret. Then, like a spent ember, it was gone.*

*It stepped out of the still-burning doorway as the structure began collapsing behind it. There was much more work to be done.*

There are individual entities that exist outside of the edges of the world with powerful influences. These beings differ from avatars in that they are not higher-order entities manifesting physical forms, but individual and unique beings capable of intruding upon the world.

#### The Gray Matron and her Wastes

One of the most infamous singulars, the Gray Matron, is a storied being across the far seas. It is said that, far in the northern unlit seas lies an artificial gray land home to crude facsimiles of Archians. These strange counterfeits are puppeteered about the Gray Wastes, a land made to vaguely resemble the natural world.

Stories of the Gray Matron and her Wastes pain the land as an almost surreal copy of the world, and the matron herself as a spindly, impossibly tall puppet master that is utterly content with her playthings.

There have never been any substantiated sightings of the Gray Matron outside of the unlit seas, and there are no officially corroborated accounts of the Matron or the Wastes. Most Archians consider the stories little more than tall tales.

### Puppeteer Prions

As higher-order beings, like the architect, cannot interact directly with the world, they must create physical entities to operate in their stead. It’s rare for any being to bypass the eternal watch of the architect, but not impossible. One such breach in cosmic security was the release of the puppeteer prions. These microscopic creatures were seeded by some higher force and were capable of taking total control over animals and Archians alike.

#### The Prion

The prions are simple creatures, small enough that they are invisible to the naked eye. Their biology is alien to this world, and they are unable to reproduce. Thus, once seeded by their master unto the world, their number cannot grow any further.

Requiring no sustenance of any sort, these beings act more as passive machines that living creatures. They are able to lay dormant indefinitely, and if ingested, will work their way towards their hosts brain. There, they will sit, still dormant, until the electrical activity of the brain ceases. At this point, the prion activates, jolting the mind back to life and taking full control of the host. These prions have an uncanny familiarity with the biology of barrier creatures and can manipulate them to an extreme degree. Even functions that were once autonomous, such as the healing of wounds or the release of hormones, can be exactly controlled by the body’s new master.

  

#### Empowered Hosts

The prion’s host, referred to as a puppet retains zero control over their minds. The hosts still require sustenance. Thanks to a supercharged immune system, courtesy of the prions, they are able to consume rotted or uncooked food. All of this nutrition feeds and improves the body, as the puppet grows stronger, faster, and more enduring than most Archians.

Much of the puppet’s capability is determined by how intact the brain was at the time of takeover. The more intact the brain, the smarter the puppet. And, due to its enhanced biological control, smarter puppets are more physically capable. The smartest puppets are able to force directed, cancer-like growths in order to enhance existing appendages or grow entirely new ones.

#### An Inscrutable Goal

The purpose of these puppets is largely unknowable. They are able to sense the presence of prions in other creatures and will work together with their fellow puppets (save for especially dire times, when lesser puppets are preyed upon by their starving superiors). They will attempt to convert infected creatures in the least destructive way, usually via strangulation. Uninfected Archians are usually slaughtered and eaten, and uninfected livestock are usually kept as a food source.

There is no clear end goal of these puppets, or the being that created them.

#### The Avana Seed

The first recorded prion seed occurred in Avana, close to the height of its power. The plaque was quickly identified, and the advanced society was able to keep it under relative control. With proper testing and adjusted end-of-life procedures, even infected individuals were able to live their lives normally. In the end, the nation lost about ten percent of its population to the fallout. This was considered a success, as over three quarters of the population had been infected.

Records of this first seed were recovered by agents of the eldest star. The order holds the existence of the prion as a closely guarded secret and has dedicated resources that scour the barrier in case of a new seed.

#### The Vijilahd Seed

During the early, expansionist years of the Brineflame Empire, a second seeding of puppeteer prions was recorded. 100% of the population of Vijilahd, a nation state vassal of the empire in the near seas, was infected, with the vast majority of them being converted throughout the course of the event. Since there were no intercontinental communication at this time, first contact was had by a merchant vessel. The empire quickly intervened, first assuming a rebel takeover. Once the nature of the violence was determined, the empire quarantined the nation in case of potential contagion and created the Imperial Containment Committee to handle the situation.

The IC, through a long series of arguably unethical tests, was able to determine the nature of the prion. They worked alongside the IN to eliminate all converted individuals and maintained close watches on infected citizens. The IC declared the operation a success when Vijilahd was cleansed of puppets, though only a small fraction of the nation was left alive. The IC continues to operate, now acting as a general aberrant intelligence bureau.

The order of the eldest star recorded the onset of this seed long before the official initial contact but abstained from any sort of intervention.

  

## 6.2  Anomalies

*"If anyone can hear me, this is lieutenant Grale of the 14th Imperial Scouts. Our patrol ran into something weird - possible deep activity. We've already lost a few soldiers. I have no idea how, they're just - they're just not here anymore. I'm requesting support, whatever this is it's keeping us from leaving this position."*

*The radio transmission played again over the hum of the truck engine before they arrived. Only three transports, supported by a single biplane overhead. The warders back at headquarters couldn't detect any sort of intrusion, and this small radio support unit was deemed sufficient for an initial reconnaissance.*

*In tall grass fields, miles and miles away from civilization, the radio operator fiddled with his instruments while his officer sighed impatiently. "So are we just gonna sit here and listen to that damned broadcast, or do you have something for me?" The operator, confused and frustrated, searched for an explanation. "Ma'am, it's right here - this is where the signal's coming from." Unamused, the officer started rousing the drivers. "Just ghost signals, we'll report back and head home. There's nothing out here." The operator, however, was unsatisfied. "These aren't ghost signals! I mean - ma'am, these signals are fresh. Actively transmitted. From right here!" Over the familiar hum of engines, the officer gave one final command. "Pack your things up, we're leaving."*

*The operator sat sullen in the back of his transport, searching his mind for some explanation. A burst of static drew him out of his stupor as the radio briefly came to life. "This is lieutenant Grale of the 14th Imperial Scouts. Please don't leave us here."*

*Imperial report on the loss of the 14th Imperial Scouts*

There are several manifestations of otherworldly forces that do not materialize in identifiable entities. These aberrant events, known generally as anomalies, are observed across the barrier at varying degrees of uncanniness.

### General Anomalous Events

Most anomalous events are simple inconsistencies usually assumed to be little more than minor incursions. The difference between lesser incursions and these small anomalies are subtle but can be important. Incursions are inherently random and purposeless, while anomalies are directly caused by some outside force poking or prodding at, or accidentally colliding with the world.

Major anomalies, especially those that occur independently of any intruding being, are exceedingly rare. These events are starkly different from major incursions and change the landscape of the barrier in drastic and purposeful ways. Most of these events occur far from the center of the barrier, away from the watchful gaze of the architect.
