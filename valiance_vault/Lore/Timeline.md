# Primordial
*Countless eons of stability*
The world was brought into being by some higher power. It was stable and self sustaining, able to cycle its energy indefinitely and without loss. This cycle operated in cosmic periods, and the most fundamental of these periods would see the world experience a repeating pattern of seasonal fluctuations. This period would eventually define a calendar year.

The primordials were given form and the purpose to act as the custodians of this world. They maintained the balance between the cosmos and the depths, acting as a ballast for their world sustaining mechanisms.

During this age, the world was built almost exclusively of primordials. All but the sea and air were eternal beings, from the vast floating continents to the networks of creeping mosses.

# The Children of Creation
*The many millions of years during which the three children reshaped the world*
The three children descended upon the world, the first and final act of the world's creator since its creation. 

Their directive was to introduce to the world a new force that acted independently of the existing cycle. To this end, the children devised and executed a plan in sequence. Once this work was complete, they were prohibited from further intervention.

## The Age of the First Child
*The first one million years after the end of the primordial era*
The goal of the first child was to gather a council of cooperative primordials. With equal parts charisma and patience, a subset of the most powerful and influential primordials pledged fealty to the children and their works.  

After the council was established and their work finished, the third child committed a final act of self annihilation. They left no trace of their existence, save for the primordial council.

## The Age of the Second Child
*The several millennia that followed the work of the first child*
The second child arrived with fury. Working alongside the primordial council, he brought low the dissident primordials that opposed his older sibling's council. 

When his work was finished, he retreated to the far, lightless edges of the world to eternally stand sentinel. It was here that surviving primordials and other aberrant beings gathered strength and threatened to enter the waking world, something that the third child could not allow.

## The Age of the Third Child
*The many millions of years leading up to the emergence*
A foil to her older brother, the third child came to the world to enact creation. Lacking the absolute power of her creator, she worked alongside the council to bring new life to the world.

In her wolrdforges, deep within the hearts of continental primordials, she toiled. After countless iterations the world was filled with all manner of things that lived and, more importantly, died. It was the concept of death that would be her greatest achievement, as it detached all of her creations from the endless cycle of this world.

Her final creation before her departure were animals unique among their peers, ones that she considered to be her own children. Within themselves they contained a shred of the third child's own will to create. These creatures, which would come to call themselves human in their varying tongues, were scattered throughout the central seas with an incredibly diverse set of genetic characteristics to ensure adaptability in any environment.

With her grand project finished, the three children had completed their work. The worldforges quieted and the third child dissolved into the sea, leaving the world with only faint wisps of her conscience. 

# The Living World
*The end of an ancient, plodding world and the beginning of human history*
With the introduction of transient life, the world began to change rapidly. Humanity found itself in a position to define their own destiny and shape the world around them.

## Emergence
*The first centuries of tribal formations*
First humans emerge across the central seas. Many generations of intermingling later, seven major tribes emerged. These tribes laid the genetic and cultural groundwork for all of human civilization that would follow.

## The First Societies
*The first 500 years of human history*
