Energy shaping, colloquially referred to as shaping, is the ability for an entity to manipulate their immediate surroundings by controlling local kinetic, thermal, and electromagnetic forces.

Primordial beings exhibit an inherent mastery in energy manipulation. Most forms of complex life possess some level shaping capability, but humans display an immense potential for shaping.

In contrast to [[The Arcane]], energy manipulation is a well understood and extensively documented phenomenon. Primordial beings display an inherent mastery of shaping.

Devices are also capable of performing shaping at various levels. Simple passive mechanisms may influence their environment in minor ways, such as adjusting local temperatures or transmitting power wirelessly. More complex machines are used in manufacturing and other industrial processes, and allow processing methods that would be impossible with purely electromechanical devices.
