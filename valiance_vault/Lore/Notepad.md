So the setting of valiance takes place roughly 8000 years after the creation of Archians?

How does the Imperial Calendar track years? When is Year 0.

When did the Shalica incident with the Selk and genesis forges happen?

Is there a timeline of major events?

Yeah, the modern setting of valiance takes place 8,000 years after the Third Child's projects ended.

The Brineflame Imperial calendar tracks years since the empire's establishment, which is about 1,000 years before the modern setting, so modernÂ  people would use the Imperial Year of ~1,000.

Carthia blew up northern Uthren around 1,000 - 1,100, Avana blew up the better part of Shalica around 3,500

There absolutely should be a timeline of major events, I'll work on getting one put together

- From a conversation with Garret
- Timeline with 4 columns: Brineflame, Carthia, Sunspire, and Other/Global (maybe this is the first?)

IC containment caution levels (only apply to currently contained threats, active threats use a different system but all have the same 0-5 scale)

Level 0: No danger presented

Level 1: Risk of harm to research team

Level 2: Risk of death to research team

Level 3: Facility wide risk (local)

Level 4: Empire wide risk (national)

Level 5: Worldwide risk (apocalyptic)

Three levels of IC response teams

Teams always operate in threes

Response team (~T3)

Silver Response Team (~T6)

Gold Response Team (~T9)

Alburn is an old city with progressively newer cities built on top of each other, creating a dense and three dimensional urban patchwork.

There is no glory in valiancy, only blood and money, in that order

All valiants are mercenaries, but not all mercenaries are valiants

A valiant is expensive and versatile, and not at all adverse to risk. They are also usually operating under a valiants' hall that handles contracting, but certain groups or individuals operate as independent valiants outside of any hall

Independent valiants are a much riskier hire but are also willing to do much less favorable work

Replace arcane with energy manip

like magnetic fields for all types of energy

bo arcane energy, just emergy manip tech

everything else funcgionaly unchange

EM for short

or maybe something else because thatalso is

rename cosmos to the heavens, cosmic beings to celestial beings




They stood together on the balcony, where they didn't have to compete with the distant chatter of mingling socialites. One of them exhaled slowly, allowing their visible breath to disperse into the cold autumn air before speaking.

"This is a dream, isn't it?"

"Of course."

A slight smile split the face of the dreamer.



Do you ever wonder if there is a god,
and we're simply not part of the bigger picture?

That somewhere out there the chosen children carry their some divine directive.
A grand work that was started long before we arrived.
And will continue long after we've left.
