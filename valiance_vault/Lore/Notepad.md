So the setting of valiance takes place roughly 8000 years after the creation of Archians?

How does the Imperial Calendar track years? When is Year 0.

When did the Shalica incident with the Selk and genesis forges happen?

Is there a timeline of major events?

Yeah, the modern setting of valiance takes place 8,000 years after the Third Child's projects ended.

The Brineflame Imperial calendar tracks years since the empire's establishment, which is about 1,000 years before the modern setting, so modernÂ  people would use the Imperial Year of ~1,000.

Carthia blew up northern Uthren around 1,000 - 1,100, Avana blew up the better part of Shalica around 3,500

There absolutely should be a timeline of major events, I'll work on getting one put together

- From a conversation with Garret
- Timeline with 4 columns: Brineflame, Carthia, Sunspire, and Other/Global (maybe this is the first?)

IC containment caution levels (only apply to currently contained threats, active threats use a different system but all have the same 0-5 scale)

Level 0: No danger presented

Level 1: Risk of harm to research team

Level 2: Risk of death to research team

Level 3: Facility wide risk (local)

Level 4: Empire wide risk (national)

Level 5: Worldwide risk (apocalyptic)

Three levels of IC response teams

Teams always operate in threes

Response team (~T3)

Silver Response Team (~T6)

Gold Response Team (~T9)

Alburn is an old city with progressively newer cities built on top of each other, creating a dense and three dimensional urban patchwork.

There is no glory in valiancy, only blood and money, in that order

All valiants are mercenaries, but not all mercenaries are valiants

A valiant is expensive and versatile, and not at all adverse to risk. They are also usually operating under a valiants' hall that handles contracting, but certain groups or individuals operate as independent valiants outside of any hall

Independent valiants are a much riskier hire but are also willing to do much less favorable work

Replace arcane with energy manip

like magnetic fields for all types of energy

bo arcane energy, just emergy manip tech

everything else funcgionaly unchange

EM for short

or maybe something else because thatalso is

rename cosmos to the heavens, cosmic beings to celestial beings




They stood together on the balcony, where they didn't have to compete with the distant chatter of mingling socialites. One of them exhaled slowly, allowing their visible breath to disperse into the cold autumn air before speaking.

"This is a dream, isn't it?"

"Of course."



Do you ever wonder if there is a god,
and we're simply not part of the bigger picture?

That somewhere out there the chosen children carry out some divine directive.
A grand work that was started long before we arrived.
And will continue long after we've left.





Before the second child, all primordials were titanic and entirely unlike the primordials seen in the modern day. Only Tekka's spawn resembled the current primordials, and they were the exception. The third child's crusade had shattered all the primordials that refused to work with the council, leaving tiny fragments of hearts strewn across the world. These hearts would grow into smaller, more plentiful primordials.


see now, the stark indifference of the stars


Change peacekeepers to Imperial Department of Security (IDS)
	colloquial slang "Ids" for equivalent of feds, otherwise police/cops for local, even though locals are still under the IDS
	Handles all internal security matters including overseeing local security (policing) departments. 
	The Containment Unit (IDS-CU) specializes in handling anomalies, including aberrant (power not native to the world) and dreg (corruptions caused by the chaos emanating from the core) incursions. Very secretive and operates out of blacksites throughout imperial waters, and plenty of non-disclosed sites beyond. 
	IDS handles criminal matters. A case is fairly simple, with IDS investigators and prosecutors presenting a case and public representatives (from a separate non-IDS dept.) acting as a counterbalance ensuring fair trials. Final decisions made by a judge from the (name pending, same department as arbiters) department

(name pending) department handles civil cases, providing arbiters and arbitration rooms for civil hearings. Arbiters hear the case and decide on the outcome based on civil law and precedent. Usually this leads to financial compensation for damages, custody of dependents, or correction of material ownership. At worst, a case can be escalated to a criminal case and handed off to the IDS.



Primordial hearts release immense radiation under strain. Considered arcane, as nobody really has any idea how they work. 

	A small ocher crytsal sat nestled in his bare hand. In any proper lab he'd be wearing a lead-lined suit and carrying the specimen in a sealed container. A part of him felt giddy at the utter lack of safety, and before he could stop himself he clutched his fingers around the crystal. It immediately became uncomfortably hot and he reflexively loosened his grip. He'd always wanted to try that.

Dr. Elizabeth Vega, dual doctorates in both biochemistry and aberrant physiology.
	Sharp of appearance and demeanor. Works for the IDS-CU. Her Intensity is balanced with a very human curiosity and a quiet disdain of utilitarian pragmaticism. Calculated, but not cold. Grew up with the pressure of an academic family. She doesn't go home for holidays. Went to a public college along with Lisette to piss her parents off (it worked) and eventually attended some very prestigious institutions (well after breaking contact with her family).
Lisette, political refugee and unlicensed arc-technician.
	Home in the near seas conquered, moved (was forcibly relocated) to Alburn as a we lass. Just enough vyld blood to be bullied in school. Grew up in a decent part of town with people she had absolutely nothing in common with, but made friends with fellow weirdo Elizabeth Vega (who envied her lack of a surname for certain reasons). Went to public school to become a machine technician, picked up the arcane bit afterwards. 

Aberrant: not native to this world 

Arcane: natural but inexplicable phenomena, not a lack of understanding but specifically cannot be pinned down with any scientific methods. Some arcane *stuff* has been sort of figured out, but only in getting something *to* work, but not understanding *how* it works. One example is slip-space technology, which allows pushing something into the (entirely undefined) "arcane space" to be retrieved at a later time. Works great for inanimate and less complex objects but storing complex biological subjects for longer than a few milliseconds tends to get messy.
Creating arcane products is a whole thing, you can run the exact same process twice and get entirely different results. So called "arcanists" will claim that since these processes were performed in different times, spaces, or whatever, that the outcome is not expected to be the same. Again, all vibes based with those weirdos.
Some simpler processes have (relatively) been nailed down. For instance, a private corporation (no name yet, something gross and business-y like "SlipTech") produces arcane mechanisms for storing objects in "local slip space", meaning it follows you around. Local to you specifically I guess? Anyways, they have optimized their process to a ridiculous extent and are able to produce one working gizmo for every ~1,000 attempted. Actually really good numbers in this industry. However, these come unattached and you'll have to find some back-alley arc-technician to affix it to something so it's actually useful. Ad then you'll have to figure out how to use it which may be more or less difficult depending on what you ate that morning and the current cosmic phase.
Shaping mechanisms are much easier to make in comparison, due to their elementary nature. Still very difficult and expensive to produce powerful devices at any real scale, but not as impossible of a task compared to more complicated arcane implements (have to go to Sunspire for those and wait a quarter century for one artisan to make you a super specific thing that will cost you a few fortunes)

Shaping: technically arcane but works so consistently and is widely accessible even if people don't *really* know how it works. Phenomenon involving the remote application of force and transfer of energy, commonly thermal or electromagnetic
Considered by some to be the fundamentals of the arcane, but as with all things arcane that theory is almost entirely vibes-based
Can be trained like any other skill. Most don't bother in the same way people don't bother learning how to fix their own motor vehicles or home appliances.
