So the setting of valiance takes place roughly 8000 years after the creation of Archians?

How does the Imperial Calendar track years? When is Year 0.

When did the Shalica incident with the Selk and genesis forges happen?

Is there a timeline of major events?

Yeah, the modern setting of valiance takes place 8,000 years after the Third Child's projects ended.

The Brineflame Imperial calendar tracks years since the empire's establishment, which is about 1,000 years before the modern setting, so modern  people would use the Imperial Year of ~1,000.

Carthia blew up northern Uthren around 1,000 - 1,100, Avana blew up the better part of Shalica around 3,500

There absolutely should be a timeline of major events, I'll work on getting one put together

- From a conversation with Garret
- Timeline with 4 columns: Brineflame, Carthia, Sunspire, and Other/Global (maybe this is the first?)

IC containment caution levels (only apply to currently contained threats, active threats use a different system but all have the same 0-5 scale)

Level 0: No danger presented

Level 1: Risk of harm to research team

Level 2: Risk of death to research team

Level 3: Facility wide risk (local)

Level 4: Empire wide risk (national)

Level 5: Worldwide risk (apocalyptic)

Three levels of IC response teams

Teams always operate in threes

Response team (~T3)

Silver Response Team (~T6)

Gold Response Team (~T9)

Alburn is an old city with progressively newer cities built on top of each other, creating a dense and three dimensional urban patchwork.

There is no glory in valiancy, only blood and money, in that order

All valiants are mercenaries, but not all mercenaries are valiants

A valiant is expensive and versatile, and not at all adverse to risk. They are also usually operating under a valiants' hall that handles contracting, but certain groups or individuals operate as independent valiants outside of any hall

Independent valiants are a much riskier hire but are also willing to do much less favorable work

Replace arcane with energy manip

like magnetic fields for all types of energy

bo arcane energy, just emergy manip tech

everything else funcgionaly unchange

EM for short

or maybe something else because thatalso is

rename cosmos to the heavens, cosmic beings to celestial beings


They stood together on the balcony, where they didn't have to compete with the chatter of mingling socialites. One of them exhaled slowly, allowing their visible breath to disperse into the cold autumn air before speaking.

"This is a dream, isn't it?"

"Of course it is."


Do you ever wonder if there is a god,
and we're simply not part of the bigger picture?

That somewhere out there the chosen children carry out some divine directive.
A grand work that was started long before we arrived.
And will continue long after we've left.


Before the second child, all primordials were titanic and entirely unlike the primordials seen in the modern day. Only Tekka's spawn resembled the current primordials, and they were the exception. The third child's crusade had shattered all the primordials that refused to work with the council, leaving tiny fragments of hearts strewn across the world. These hearts would grow into smaller, more plentiful primordials.


see now, the stark indifference of the stars


Change peacekeepers to Imperial Department of Security (IDS)
	colloquial slang "Ids" for equivalent of feds, otherwise police/cops for local, even though locals are still under the IDS
	Handles all internal security matters including overseeing local security (policing) departments. 
	The Containment Unit (IDS-CU) specializes in handling anomalies, including aberrant (power not native to the world) and dreg (corruptions caused by the chaos emanating from the core) incursions. Very secretive and operates out of blacksites throughout imperial waters, and plenty of non-disclosed sites beyond. 
	IDS handles criminal matters. A case is fairly simple, with IDS investigators and prosecutors presenting a case and public representatives (from a separate non-IDS dept.) acting as a counterbalance ensuring fair trials. Final decisions made by a judge from the (name pending, same department as arbiters) department

(name pending) department handles civil cases, providing arbiters and arbitration rooms for civil hearings. Arbiters hear the case and decide on the outcome based on civil law and precedent. Usually this leads to financial compensation for damages, custody of dependents, or correction of material ownership. At worst, a case can be escalated to a criminal case and handed off to the IDS.


Primordial hearts release immense radiation under strain. Considered arcane, as nobody really has any idea how they work. 

	A small ocher crytsal sat nestled in his bare hand. In any proper lab he'd be wearing a lead-lined suit and carrying the specimen in a sealed container. A part of him felt giddy at the utter lack of safety, and before he could stop himself he clutched his fingers around the crystal. It immediately became uncomfortably hot and he reflexively loosened his grip. He'd always wanted to try that.

Dr. Elizabeth Vega, dual doctorates in both biochemistry and aberrant physiology.
	Sharp of appearance and demeanor. Works for the IDS-CU. Her Intensity is balanced with a very human curiosity and a quiet disdain of utilitarian pragmaticism. Calculated, but not cold. Grew up with the pressure of an academic family. She doesn't go home for holidays. Went to a public college along with Lisette to piss her parents off (it worked) and eventually attended some very prestigious institutions (well after breaking contact with her family).
Ceta (See-tuh, orr C for short) (NOT say-tuh), political refugee and unlicensed arc-technician turned valiant.
	Home in the near seas conquered, moved (was forcibly relocated) to Alburn as a we lass. Just enough vyld blood to be bullied in school. Grew up in a decent part of town with people she had absolutely nothing in common with, but made friends with fellow weirdo Elizabeth Vega (who envied her lack of a surname for certain reasons). Went to public school to become a machine technician, picked up the arcane bit afterwards. An accident at work left the right side of her body heavily scarred. She received no compensation (long story) and turned to less savory work as a way to temporarily make ends meet (ended up not being temporary).
	"I showed up here and was herded through their little lines like livestock. The asshole running the medical exams called me a little boy and I was like the fuck you mean boy? My parents (who I was currently separated from for the exam - no red flags there) told me not to think about it, but that piece of shit was basically my welcoming wagon. It didn't end there, all of these assholes at these state hospitals kept going on about my 'biology' like seriously? My biology is a bitch with horns, fuck off."

Ceta's long story
	Ceta worked at a leading arc-manufacturing company that she's not allowed to name or claim any association with. While performing a, off-shit machine refit a foreman showed up with a suit and some crazy ideas about an impromptu run on the line she was tending to. She told them to fuck off, the machine was locked out and the maintenance wouldn't be done in time for their little experiment. They bypassed her lockout and started the machine while she was elbow deep in it. A misaligned (or rather, in the process of being aligned) aperture erupted into shards of molten metal that left her permanently disfigured. The company blamed her for the mistake and loss of some their extremely expensive equipment. Eventually they settled and dropped their charges, but evaded any form of compensation and probiting any future interactions of any kind with the company.

Aberrant: not native to this world 

Arcane: natural but inexplicable phenomena, not a lack of understanding but specifically cannot be pinned down with any scientific methods. Some arcane *stuff* has been sort of figured out, but only in getting something *to* work, but not understanding *how* it works. One example is slip-space technology, which allows pushing something into the (entirely undefined) "arcane space" to be retrieved at a later time. Works great for inanimate and less complex objects but storing complex biological subjects for longer than a few milliseconds tends to get messy.
Creating arcane products is a whole thing, you can run the exact same process twice and get entirely different results. So called "arcanists" will claim that since these processes were performed in different times, spaces, or whatever, that the outcome is not expected to be the same. Again, all vibes based with those weirdos.
Some simpler processes have (relatively) been nailed down. For instance, a private corporation (no name yet, something gross and business-y like "SlipTech") produces arcane mechanisms for storing objects in "local slip space", meaning it follows you around. Local to you specifically I guess? Anyways, they have optimized their process to a ridiculous extent and are able to produce one working gizmo for every ~1,000 attempted. Actually really good numbers in this industry. However, these come unattached and you'll have to find some back-alley arc-technician to affix it to something so it's actually useful. Ad then you'll have to figure out how to use it which may be more or less difficult depending on what you ate that morning and the current cosmic phase.
Shaping mechanisms are much easier to make in comparison, due to their elementary nature. Still very difficult and expensive to produce powerful devices at any real scale, but not as impossible of a task compared to more complicated arcane implements (have to go to Sunspire for those and wait a quarter century for one artisan to make you a super specific thing that will cost you a few fortunes)

Shaping: technically arcane but works so consistently and is widely accessible even if people don't *really* know how it works. Phenomenon involving the remote application of force and transfer of energy, commonly thermal or electromagnetic
Considered by some to be the fundamentals of the arcane, but as with all things arcane that theory is almost entirely vibes-based
Can be trained like any other skill. Most don't bother in the same way people don't bother learning how to fix their own motor vehicles or home appliances. 


Use lineage (and change to "ancestries") like nationalities, but like ancestral nationalities
Nation of Selk, Selkin
	- Capital Sunspire, "Selk" means the sun in Selkin
	- One of the few nationalities that has survived throughout history, even if the society around it has changed 
Old Nation of Saphir, Saphiran
	- Capital Saphis, "Saph" refers to sapphire (the color not strictly the gemstone) in Saphiran
	- One half o the "imperial" lineages, Saph still operates as a major imperial city and a cultural and mercantile hub
Historical Nation of Marro, Marr
	- Was replaced in its entirety by the nation of Carthia, one of the first major multicultural settlements
	- Carthia comes from "Carth", and old Marr word for crossroads
	- Marr people diffused into the various nations of the central sea, though some in Carthia still trace their ancestry back to the original Marr
The Ing, Ingra
	- Term nation used very loosely here, with "Ing", the word Ingra referred to themselves as, translating to family
	- While lineages have blended over the millennia, the Ingra culture has proved resilient and Ingra settlements survive to the modern day
Derga Kingdoms, Derge (g pronounced like a j)
	- A collection of warring kingdoms situated in the mountains north of Carthia
	- They fought not for land or resources but for supremacy, with the strongest kingdom acting as the rules of the Derga kingdoms
	- "Derga" roughly translates to "winner" or "champion", and is the title given to the ruling kingdom (internally the Derge refer to each kingdom as a separate people, with Derga/Derge being the all-encompassing term)
Hjark, Hjarren (hj pronounced like a y)
	- Capital Hjarkveld, literally translating to "greatest mountain" in Hjarren (and "Hjarren" translating to "mountain people")
	- Hardy and industrious, utilized natural resources in Shalica's Spine mountain range to become the first properly industrialized nation
	- Hjarkveld fell during the Shalica conflict, surviving city of Southstar (named using the imperial tongue which was in wide use at this point) established as the new imperial hub on Shalica (until Alburn)
	- One Half of the "imperial" lineages, used it's position on Shalica to expand the North Sea Alliance (which would later become the North Sea Empire and colloquially "the empire")
Vyld Collective, Vyldan (y pronounced like ee)
	- No true capital, the original Vyld Collective ("Vyld" meaning "forest", literally the "forest people") was a community spread across the northern woodlands of Shalica (back before the conflict when Shalica had northern woodlands)
	- Longstanding but sort of uneasy peace between the Vyld and the Hjark (and eventually the North Sea Alliance/Empire)
	- Plenty of Vyld left to settle in and around other nations but very few came to hang out with them (racism) (they were chill though and very welcoming)
	- Genetically unstable with a host of animalistic mutations (source of a lot of the racism) and naturally intersex (source of even more racism)
	- Arguably hit the hardest by the Shalican conflict even though they just tried to stay out of it, reduced their home to a small portion of ravaged woodland but they make do
Cossim (just Cossim)
	- Weird star people (no biological sex, no reproducing, biologically immortal) and not even a nation or an ancestry just a strange thing that happens
	- Born very rarely (roughly 1 in 1 million) and completely arbitrarily
	- Most of their ancestry is overwritten by whatever cosmic curse this is

Corpse Oil
	Oil harvested from the bodies of long dead leviathans. These leviathans were titanic primordials killed during the second child's crusade. The were bored into and their heart shattered, leaving their protobiological corpse to slowly congeal into an energy dense oil.
	The corpses can be rarely found in the far seas, drifting in the dark waters. Some have become small wandering islands, hosting their own unique biospheres.
	The oil drilled from continental bodies similar but far less fermented as it's drilled from the bodies of living Ithian primordials. It was only in recent history that this connection was made and that the continents were discovered to themselves be primordial beings.

Nyla and Igro
	The abyssal primordial Nyla is one of the few beings able to withstand the deepest depths of the seas. She feeds on dregs near the ice floor and is able to safely metabolize the corrupted matter. She is connected to the council via Igro, her only companion and one of the other beings able to survive that far below the surface. 
	Igro is a unique primordial in that they have no static body. They are able to shed and rebuild forms around their heart at will, allowing them to adapt to the most extreme locales. Igro, realizing Nyla's important role in maintaining balance, brought her into the fold of the council the protect her from the wrath of the second child.

In this world power is seized, protected, cultivated, delegated, and diluted in an endless river of violence driven by extreme scarcity. It's a world where the line between tough decisions and intentional cruelty is blurred to nonexistence. It's vast, beautiful, and it's home. 

There are no condolences that can reach the dead
