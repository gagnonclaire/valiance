The forest vale was foggy this autumn morning. There was a stream running through a clearing here, its soft trickling muffled by the cold blanket covering the valley.

Twigs snapped and leaves crunched underfoot as a young girl skipped into the clearing. In muddy shoes and a hand-me-down coat, she surveyed the clearing, peering intently through the fog. Her cracked lips broke into a smile when she spotted an old twisting trunk on the opposite tree line. Just large enough to bear her weight, its gnarled branches formed an arboreal playground just above the forest floor.

The fog began to lift, and the early morning sun pierced the muted horizon. Cradled in the old tree's branches, the girl let out a disappointed sigh. She started to untangle herself, hoping she could make it back home before she was missed. Her ankle had been caught up in a thin but unrelenting web of vines. Unbothered, she dug an old pocket knife from a coat pocket. It was worn, but well cared for. She flipped it open, bent over and applied the blade to the knot of fibers. It gave more easily than she had expected, flinging the knife's edge towards her opposite hand. She winced at the brief pain and surveyed the damage. A clean cut, just deep enough to bleed.

The girl's stomach began to churn as she watched the thin crimson drip make its way down her finger towards her palm. Her vision blurred and the gurgling of the creak faded far into the distance, as did she.

Under a warm morning sun, a young girl awoke at the edge of a clearing. With a bruised shoulder and a new tear in her coat, she scrambled to her feet. Clutching a bloodied finger, she found her bearings and rushed out of the clearing. Her absence was most definitely noticed by now, and the consequences of that eclipsed her superficial injuries. As her rushed steps faded into the forest, the creek continued to bubble, happily unaware.

-

She sat bloody and alone in the dark, fixated on the dull glow of the captured singularity she now held. Outside of time and space, she wondered at how everything in her life led up to this. Every drop of blood she had shed, a crimson ocean to hold what? This small thing, hardly able to fill her palm? If the her life had truly culminated with this, how could she feel anything other than disappointment? But in this infinite space between life and death, she made peace with that.

Four sequential charges erupted at each corner of the gate, the resulting implosions annihilating the heavy locks holding the outer shielding in place. A combination of impact drills and fusion torches worked their way into the sanctum beyond the gate. There, A team of three found what they were looking for. 

A hulking machine rendered inert, its two experimental power cores neatly packaged on the floor. And their primary target, held in its inner casing by a bloody mess of a woman.

The team moved into the sanctum, taking inventory beneath the blaring of ancient sirens. 

"Power core one and two, in good condition."

"Singularity installed in the transportation cell, ready to go."

One paused as the team prepared to exfiltrate, taking one last look at the woman. She knelt with empty hands, breathing short and shallow. 

"What about her?"

The three exchanged quick glances.

"Not on the list."

The flashing lights of the city below briefly illuminated the details of a dimly lit office. A faded family photo on the desk, facing away from the man sitting at it. A gaudy certificate embellished with gold leaf hanging over his head. Bookshelves full of dusty, unlabeled books flanking him on either side. With a sigh and a hollow tone, he cut between her glances.

"I take it the decor is to your liking?"

The remark warranted no response. He looked past her towards the open door. She shifted slightly, centering herself back in his view.

"Ok... If you can take a seat and we can-"
"I'll stand."

She crossed her arms and fixed her gaze. The skyline reflected off of the razor hanging at her hip, now exposed. Standard pattern, but clearly made from something other than simple surplus steel.

"Ok, that's uh, fine."

He straightened his sleeves and gathered a small stack of papers. 

"It should all be here, I can make a copy after-"
"I'll just take those."

A pause. He made a scene of searching his desk for something he could not find. When he surfaced, he was met with an expectant, outstretched hand. Old scars dug deep into the palm, and he followed them up a ravaged wrist until a snap pulled him back.

"Documents."

The man gathered himself and his papers, sleaves wrinkling around his arms. Standing from his desk, handed over the packet.

"If you need me, call-"
"I won't"

A sigh of relief was held back as to not betray any fear as the woman flipped through the folder idly. Her eyes stared through the pages until she raised them to meet a nervous gaze.

"If you need me,"

She paused, a slight smile revealing a flash of teeth.

"Call me."

With a careless twirl she exited, accompanied by one last metallic shimmer. As his guest disappeared into the dark halls beyond the open door, the man slumped back into his seat. A shaky hand grabbed at a note on the corner of his desk. Scanning through it again and again, he found himself with the same smile. There would undoubtedly be blood, and more than he had paid for.

The phone rang through an apartment, piercing the television static that had filled it. At the corner of the room, something shifted. The shuffling of fabric was followed by a muffled groan and another piercing ring. Heavy blankets hit the floor and wet footsteps approached the phone as it rang again. The flickering light of the television revealed a woman stained red, bleeding from a fresh wound at her side. A scarred hand staunched the flow while the other reached for the phone as it rang again.

"hello..?"
"Ceta? Is that you?"
"yeah..? this is my phone..."

She strained under some unseen weight before continuing.

"liz, now's not a great-"
"Are you ok?! You sound like you're dying."
"yeah"

The sound of static once again filled the room.

"liz i fucked up"
"I'm coming over."

-

"liz, i fucked up"
"I know, you told me. Now shut up and hold this on this your neck."

She shoved a handful of gauze towards Ceta's chest. 

"what's this"

With equal parts frustration and exhaustion, Elizabeth spoke slowly between sutures.

"For your neck. And stop talking, just focus on breathing."

Finished with her hasty needlework, she looked up and adjusted Ceta's handful of gauze a few inches to her right to cover a nasty laceration.
