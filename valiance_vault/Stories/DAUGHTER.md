#### Daughter

The forest vale was foggy this autumn morning. There was a stream running through a clearing here, its soft trickling muffled by the cold blanket covering the valley.

Twigs snapped and leaves crunched underfoot as a young girl skipped into the clearing. In muddy shoes and a hand-me-down coat, she surveyed the clearing, peering intently through the fog. Her cracked lips broke into a smile when she spotted an old twisting trunk on the opposite tree line. Just large enough to bear her weight, its gnarled branches formed an arboreal playground just above the forest floor.

The fog began to lift, and the early morning sun pierced the muted horizon. Cradled in the old tree's branches, the girl let out a disappointed sigh. She started to untangle herself, hoping she could make it back home before she was missed. Her ankle had been caught up in a thin but unrelenting web of vines. Unbothered, she dug an old pocket knife from a coat pocket. It was worn, but well cared for. She flipped it open, bent over and applied the blade to the knot of fibers. It gave more easily than she had expected, flinging the knife's edge towards her opposite hand. She winced at the brief pain and surveyed the damage. A clean cut, just deep enough to bleed.

The girl's stomach began to churn as she watched the thin crimson drip make its way down her finger towards her palm. Her vision blurred and the gurgling of the creak faded far into the distance, as did she.

Under a warm morning sun, a young girl awoke at the edge of a clearing. With a bruised should and a fresh tear in her coat, she scrambled to her feet. Clutching a bloodied finger, she found her bearing and rushed out of the clearing. Her absence was most definitely noticed by now, and the consequences of that eclipsed her superficial injuries. As her rushed steps faded into the forest, the creek continued to bubble, happily unaware.

-

She sat bloody and alone in the dark, fixated on the dull glow of the captured singularity she now held. Outside of time and space, she wondered at how everything in her life led up to this. Every drop of blood she had shed, a crimson ocean to hold what? This small thing, hardly able to fill her palm? If the worth of her life had truly culminated with this, how could she feel anything other than disappointment? But in this infinite space between life and death, she made peace with that.

Four sequential charges erupted at each corner of the gate, the resulting implosions annihilating the heavy locks holding the outer shielding in place. A combination of impact drills and fusion torches worked their way into the sanctum beyond the gate. There, the team of three operatives found what they were looking for. A hulking machine rendered inert, its two experimental power cores neatly packaged on the floor. And their primary target, held in its inner casing by a bloody mess of a woman.

Nobody spoke, leaving only the blaring of alarms. The team began collecting what they had come here for.

"Power core one and two, in good condition."

"Singularity installed in the transportation cell, ready to go."

One of the operatives paused as the team prepared to exfiltrate as one member took one last look at the kneeling woman, her hands now empty.

"What about her?"

The three exchanged quick glances before an answer came.

"She's not on the list."

#### Empress

The daughter lies cradled in silky, crimson folds. Light from a high window illuminates webs of veins under her translucent skin. She sleeps soundly, sheltered from the cutting winds howling outside.

The empress is away, her child left alone and unaware in her absence. The empress has been away for a very long time.

The comfortable repetition of a constant rumble of heavy tires was broken by a crackling voice.

"Five minutes out, get your shit together."

In the back of the armored truck, four operatives gathered their equipment. The first operative, a woman with a gravely voice, spoke over the sounds of shuffling cartridges and tightening straps.

"Anyone else feel like something's off here? Like there's something strange about this one?"

"No shit Syb, every job we do is so far beyond strange. That's like our whole thing. What's strange is you just now coming to that realization, what's strange is -"

"No need for that, let her explain."

The quiet interruption from the third operative's soft voice stilled the mounting tension, and the group leaned in unison as the truck took a sharp turn to the left. The soft rumbling of pavement gave way to rough country roads.

"One minute."

The tires ground against the gravel, the new soundscape resurrecting the sense of unease.

"Ok so what about you Jay, any thoughts on this? You think this one's a bit strange, maybe even weird? Maybe, maybe even a little -"

The truck came to an abrupt stop, and the fourth operative spoke plainly.

"I think we're here."

-

Four figures crept like shadows through the humid summer night along an unkempt trail. At the end of the overgrown path sat a small house, old but cared for, much unlike the road that led to it. 

Among the trees, the sounds and lights of the city no more than a few miles north were all but nonexistent.
