### Gameplay Setup
Valiance requires one player to run the game and three to five additional players that each control their own character. The game focuses on these primary characters, following their experiences.

The players, the rules, and at least three six-sided dice are the only things strictly required to play Valiance. Supplements such as a physical or virtual tabletop, character sheets, and player journals are recommended to support more comprehensive gameplay.

### Activity Queues
All activities, in or out of combat, are queued in the order they are declared. While no activity is being raised by a player, the scene continues to play out as pending activities occur sequentially.

The result of any given activity is ultimately determined by the player running the game.

#### Impossible Activities
Some activities will become impossible between the time they are stated and the point at which they would occur in the scene. These are usually ignored, having no effect on the scene.

#### Adjusting Activities
Players may adjust their characters' actions as the scene plays out. This is effectively a new activity that can be declared and added to the queue. Depending on the current events in the scene and previously queued activities, the adjustments may be more or less effective.

### Rounding
In any case where calculations result in a fraction, the result is rounded down.

TODO: sections each with links to the more comprehensive docs for that
Also each compendium should be separated into the data (traits and abilities) and the rules associated (equip limits, archetype investments, etc.)

And some somewhat seperate ref to [[The World of Archaea]] as another way to get there other than from the top lev
